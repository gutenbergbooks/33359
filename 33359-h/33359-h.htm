<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The recent expedition to Lhasa was full of interest,
not only on account of the political issues involved
and the physical difficulties overcome, but owing
to the many dramatic incidents which attended the
Mission's progress. It was my good fortune to
witness nearly all these stirring events, and I have
written the following narrative of what I saw in
the hope that a continuous story of the affair may
interest readers who have hitherto been able to
form an idea of it only from the telegrams in the
daily Press. The greater part of the book was
written on the spot, while the impressions of events
and scenery were still fresh. Owing to wounds I
was not present at the bombardment and relief of
Gyantse, but this phase of the operations is dealt
with by Mr. Henry Newman, <i>Reuter's</i> correspondent,
who was an eye-witness. I am especially
indebted to him for his account, which was written
in Lhasa, and occupied many mornings that might
have been devoted to well-earned rest.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to the Proprietors of the
<i>Daily Mail</i> for permission to use material of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
they hold the copyright; and I am indebted to the
Editors of the <i>Graphic</i> and <i>Black and White</i> for
allowing me to reproduce certain photographs by
Lieutenant Bailey.</p>

<p>The illustrations are from sketches by Lieutenant
Rybot, and photographs by Lieutenants Bailey,
Bethell, and Lewis, to whom I owe my cordial
thanks.</p>

<small>THE CAUSES OF THE EXPEDITION</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conduct of Great Britain in her relations with
Tibet puts me in mind of the dilemma of a big
boy at school who submits to the attacks of a precocious
youngster rather than incur the imputation
of 'bully.' At last the situation becomes intolerable,
and the big boy, bully if you will, turns on
the youth and administers the deserved thrashing.
There is naturally a good deal of remonstrance
from spectators who have not observed the byplay
which led to the encounter. But sympathy
must be sacrificed to the restitution of fitting and
respectful relations.</p>

<p>The aim of this record of an individual's impressions
of the recent Tibetan expedition is to
convey some idea of the life we led in Tibet, the
scenes through which we passed, and the strange
people we fought and conquered. We killed
several thousand of these brave, ill-armed men;
and as the story of the fighting is not always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
pleasant reading, I think it right before describing
the punitive side of the expedition to make
it quite clear that military operations were unavoidable&mdash;that
we were drawn into the vortex
of war against our will by the folly and obstinacy
of the Tibetans.</p>

<p>The briefest review of the rebuffs Great Britain
has submitted to during the last twenty years
will suffice to show that, so far from being to
blame in adopting punitive measures, she is open
to the charge of unpardonable weakness in allowing
affairs to reach the crisis which made such
punishment necessary.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Tibet has not
always been closed to strangers. The history of
European travellers in Lhasa forms a literature
to itself. Until the end of the eighteenth century
only physical obstacles stood in the way of an
entry to the capital. Jesuits and Capuchins
reached Lhasa, made long stays there, and were
even encouraged by the Tibetan Government.
The first<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Europeans to visit the city and leave
an authentic record of their journey were the
Fathers Grueber and d'Orville, who penetrated
Tibet from China in 1661 by the Sining route, and
stayed in Lhasa two months. In 1715 the Jesuits
Desideri and Freyre reached Lhasa; Desideri
stayed there thirteen years. In 1719 arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Horace de la Penna and the Capuchin Mission,
who built a chapel and a hospice, made several
converts, and were not finally expelled till 1740.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The Dutchman Van der Putte, first layman to
penetrate to the capital, arrived in 1720, and
stayed there some years. After this we have no
record of a European reaching Lhasa until the
adventurous journey in 1811 of Thomas Manning,
the first and only Englishman to reach the city
before this year. Manning arrived in the retinue
of a Chinese General whom he had met at Phari
Jong, and whose gratitude he had won for medical
services. He remained in the capital four months,
and during his stay he made the acquaintance of
several Chinese and Tibetan officials, and was even
presented to the Dalai Lama himself. The influence
of his patron, however, was not strong
enough to insure his safety in the city. He was
warned that his life was endangered, and returned
to India by the same way he came. In 1846 the
Lazarist missionaries Huc and Gabet reached
Lhasa in the disguise of Lamas after eighteen
months' wanderings through China and Mongolia,
during which they must have suffered as much
from privations and hardships as any travellers
who have survived to tell the tale. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
received kindly by the Amban and Regent, but
permission to stay was firmly refused them on
the grounds that they were there to subvert the
religion of the State. Despite the attempts of
several determined travellers, none of whom got
within a hundred miles of Lhasa, the Lazarist
fathers were the last Europeans to set foot in the
city until Colonel Younghusband rode through
the Pargo Kaling gate on August 4, 1904.</p>

<p>The records of these travellers to Lhasa, and
of others who visited different parts of Tibet
before the end of the eighteenth century, do not
point to any serious political obstacles to the
admission of strangers. Two centuries ago,
Europeans might travel in remote parts of Asia
with greater safety than is possible to-day. Suspicions
have naturally increased with our encroachments,
and the white man now inspires
fear where he used only to awake interest.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The policy of strict exclusion in Tibet seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
have been synchronous with Chinese ascendancy.
At the end of the eighteenth century the Nepalese
invaded and overran the country. The Lamas
turned to China for help, and a force of 70,000
men was sent to their assistance. The Chinese
drove the Gurkhas over their frontier, and practically
annihilated their army within a day's march
of Khatmandu. From this date China has virtually
or nominally ruled in Lhasa, and an important
result of her intervention has been to sow
distrust of the British. She represented that we
had instigated the Nepalese invasion, and warned
the Lamas that the only way to obviate our
designs on Tibet was to avoid all communication
with India, and keep the passes strictly closed to
foreigners.</p>

<p>Shortly before the Nepalese War, Warren Hastings
had sent the two missions of Bogle and
Turner to Shigatze. Bogle was cordially received
by the Grand Teshu Lama, and an intimate
friendship was established between the two men.
On his return to India he reported that the only
bar to a complete understanding with Tibet was
the obstinacy of the Regent and the Chinese
agents at Lhasa, who were inspired by Peking.
An attempt was arranged to influence the Chinese
Government in the matter, but both Bogle and
the Teshu Lama died before it could be carried
out. Ten years later Turner was despatched to
Tibet, and received the same welcome as his predecessor.
Everything pointed to the continuance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of a steady and consistent policy by which the
barrier of obstruction might have been broken
down. But Warren Hastings was recalled in
1785, and Lord Cornwallis, the next Governor-General,
took no steps to approach and conciliate
the Tibetans. It was in 1792 that the Tibetan-Nepalese
War broke out, which, owing to the
misrepresentations of China, precluded any possibility
of an understanding between India and
Tibet. Such was the uncompromising spirit of
the Lamas that, until Lord Dufferin sanctioned
the commercial mission of Mr. Colman Macaulay
in 1886, no succeeding Viceroy after Warren
Hastings thought it worth while to renew the
attempt to enter into friendly relations with the
country.</p>

</div>

<p>The Macaulay Mission incident was the beginning
of that weak and abortive policy which
lost us the respect of the Tibetans, and led to
the succession of affronts and indignities which
made the recent expedition to Lhasa inevitable.
The escort had already advanced into Sikkim,
and Mr. Macaulay was about to join it, when
orders were received from Government for its
return. The withdrawal was a concession to the
Chinese, with whom we were then engaged in the
delimitation of the Burmese frontier. This display
of weakness incited the Tibetans to such a
pitch of vanity and insolence that they invaded
our territory and established a military post at
Lingtu, only seventy miles from Darjeeling.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>We allowed the invaders to remain in the protected
State of Sikkim two years before we made
any reprisal. In 1888, after several vain appeals
to China to use her influence to withdraw the
Tibetan troops, we reluctantly decided on a
military expedition. The Tibetans were driven
from their position, defeated in three separate
engagements, and pursued over the frontier as
far as Chumbi. We ought to have concluded a
treaty with them on the spot, when we were in a
position to enforce it, but we were afraid of offending
the susceptibilities of China, whose suzerainty
over Tibet we still recognised, though she had
acknowledged her inability to restrain the Tibetans
from invading our territory. At the conclusion
of the campaign, in which the Tibetans showed
no military instincts whatever, we returned to
our post at Gnatong, on the Sikkim frontier.</p>

<p>After two years of fruitless discussion, a convention
was drawn up between Great Britain and
China, by which Great Britain's exclusive control
over the internal administration and foreign relations
of Sikkim was recognised, the Sikkim-Tibet
boundary was defined, and both Powers undertook
to prevent acts of aggression from their respective
sides of the frontier. The questions of pasturage,
trade facilities, and the method in which official
communications should be conducted between the
Government of India and the authorities at Lhasa
were deferred for future discussion. Nearly
three more years passed before the trade regulations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
were drawn up in Darjeeling&mdash;in December,
1903. The negociations were characterized by
the same shuffling and equivocation on the part
of the Chinese, and the same weak-kneed policy
of forbearance and conciliation on the part of the
British. Treaty and regulations were alike impotent,
and our concessions went so far that we
exacted nothing as the fruit of our victory over
the Tibetans&mdash;not even a fraction of the cost of
the campaign.</p>

<p>Our ignorance of the Tibetans, their Government,
and their relations with China was at this
time so profound that we took our cue from the
Chinese, who always referred to the Lhasa
authorities as 'the barbarians.' The Shata Shap√©,
the most influential of the four members of Council,
attended the negociations on behalf of the Tibetans.
He was officially ignored, and no one thought of
asking him to attach his signature to the treaty.
The omission was a blunder of far-reaching consequences.
Had we realized that Chinese authority
was practically non-existent in Lhasa, and that
the temporal affairs of Tibet were mainly directed
by the four Shap√©s and the Tsong-du (the very
existence of which, by the way, was unknown to
us), we might have secured a diplomatic agent in
the Shata Shap√© who would have proved invaluable
to us in our future relations with the country.
Unfortunately, during his stay in Darjeeling the
Shap√©'s feelings were lacerated by ill-treatment
as well as neglect. In an unfortunate encounter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
with British youth, which was said to have arisen
from his jostling an English lady off the path, he
was taken by the scruff of the neck and ducked
in the public fountain. So he returned to Tibet
with no love for the English, and after certain
courteous overtures from the agents of 'another
Power,' became a confirmed, though more or less
accidental, Russophile. Though deposed,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he has
at the present moment a large following among
the monks of the Gaden monastery.</p>

<p>In the regulations of 1893 it was stipulated that
a trade mart should be established at Yatung, a
small hamlet six miles beyond our frontier. The
place is obviously unsuitable, situated as it is in
a narrow pine-clad ravine, where one can throw
a stone from cliff to cliff across the valley. No
traders have ever resorted there, and the Tibetans
have studiously boycotted the place. To show
their contempt for the treaty, and their determination
to ignore it, they built a wall a quarter of a
mile beyond the Customs House, through which
no Tibetan or British subject was allowed to
pass, and, to nullify the object of the mart, a tax
of 10 per cent. on Indian goods was levied at
Phari. Every attempt was made by Sheng Tai,
the late Amban, to induce the Tibetans to substitute
Phari for Yatung as a trade mart. But,
as an official report admits, 'it was found impossible
to overcome their reluctance. Yatung was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
eventually accepted both by the Chinese and
British Governments as the only alternative to
breaking off the negociations altogether.' This
confession of weakness appears to me abject
enough to quote as typical of our attitude throughout.
In deference to Tibetan wishes, we allowed
nearly every clause of the treaty to be separately
stultified.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, as might be expected, met our
forbearance by further rebuffs. Not content with
evading their treaty obligations in respect to trade,
they proceeded to overthrow our boundary pillars,
violate grazing rights, and erect guard-houses at
Giagong, in Sikkim territory. When called to
question they repudiated the treaty, and said
that it had never been shown them by the Amban.
It had not been sealed or confirmed by any
Tibetan representative, and they had no intention
of observing it.</p>

<p>Once more the 'solemn farce' was enacted of
an appeal to China to use her influence with the
Lhasa authorities. And it was only after repeated
representations had been made by the
Indian Government to the Secretary of State that
the Home Government realized the seriousness of
the situation, and the hopelessness of making any
progress through the agency of China. 'We
seem,' said Lord Curzon, 'in respect to our policy
in Tibet, to be moving in a vicious circle. If we
apply to Tibet we either receive no reply or are
referred to the Chinese Resident; if we apply to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the latter, he excuses his failure by his inability
to put any pressure upon Tibet.' In the famous
despatch of January 8, 1903, the Viceroy described
the Chinese suzerainty as 'a political fiction,' only
maintained because of its convenience to both
parties. China no doubt is capable of sending
sufficient troops to Lhasa to coerce the Tibetans.
But it has suited her book to maintain the present
elusive and anomalous relations with Tibet, which
are a securer buttress to her western dependencies
against encroachment than the strongest army
corps. For many years we have been the butt of
the Tibetans, and China their stalking-horse.</p>

<p>The Tibetan attitude was clearly expressed by
the Shigatze officials at Khamba Jong in September
last year, when they openly boasted that
'where Chinese policy was in accordance with their
own views they were ready enough to accept the
Amban's advice; but if this advice ran counter
in any respect to their national prejudices, the
Chinese Emperor himself would be powerless to
influence them.' China has on several occasions
confessed her inability to coerce the Tibetans.
She has proved herself unable to enforce the observance
of treaties or even to restrain her subjects
from invading our territory, and during the recent
attempts at negociations she had to admit that
her representative in Lhasa was officially ignored,
and not even allowed transport to travel in the
country. In the face of these facts her exceedingly
shadowy suzerainty may be said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
entirely evaporated, and it is unreasonable to
expect us to continue our relations with Tibet
through the medium of Peking.</p>

</div>

<p>It was not until nine years after the signing of
the convention that we made any attempt to
open direct communications with the Tibetans
themselves. It is astonishing that we allowed
ourselves to be hoodwinked so long. But this
policy of drift and waiting is characteristic of
our foreign relations all over the world. British
Cabinets seem to believe that cure is better than
prevention, and when faced by a dilemma have
seldom been known to act on the initiative, or
take any decided course until the very existence
of their dependency is imperilled.</p>

<p>In 1901 Lord Curzon was permitted to send a
despatch to the Dalai Lama in which it was
pointed out that his Government had consistently
defied and ignored treaty rights; and in view of
the continued occupation of British territory, the
destruction of frontier pillars, and the restrictions
imposed on Indian trade, we should be compelled
to resort to more practical measures to enforce
the observance of the treaty, should he remain
obstinate in his refusal to enter into friendly
relations. The letter was returned unopened,
with the verbal excuse that the Chinese did not
permit him to receive communications from any
foreign Power. Yet so great was our reluctance
to resort to military coercion that we might even
at this point have let things drift, and submitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to the rebuffs of these impossible Tibetans, had
not the Dalai Lama chosen this moment for
publicly flaunting his relations with Russia.</p>

<p>The second<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Tibetan Mission reached St. Petersburg
in June, 1901, carrying autograph letters and
presents to the Czar from the Dalai Lama. Count
Lamsdorff declared that the mission had no
political significance whatever. We were asked
to believe that these Lamas travelled many
thousand miles to convey a letter that expressed
the hope that the Russian Foreign Minister was
in good health and prosperous, and informed him
that the Dalai Lama was happy to be able to say
that he himself enjoyed excellent health.</p>

<p>It is possible that the mission to St. Petersburg
was of a purely religious character, and that there
was no secret understanding at the time between
the Lhasa authorities and Russia. Yet the fact
that the mission was despatched in direct contradiction
to the national policy of isolation that had
been respected for over a century, and at a time
when the Tibetans were aware of impending
British activity to exact fulfilment of the treaty
obligations so long ignored by them, points to
some secret influence working in Lhasa in favour
of Russia, and opposed to British interests. The
process of Russification that has been carried on
with such marked success in Persia and Turkestan,
Merv and Bokhara, was being applied in Tibet. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
has long been known to our Intelligence Department
that certain Buriat Lamas, subjects of the
Czar, and educated in Russia, have been acting
as intermediaries between Lhasa and St. Petersburg.
The chief of these, one Dorjieff, headed the
so-called religious mission of 1901, and has been
employed more than once as the Dalai Lama's
ambassador to St. Petersburg. Dorjieff is a man
of fifty-eight, who has spent some twenty years
of his life in Lhasa, and is known to be the right-hand
adviser of the Dalai Lama. No doubt
Dorjieff played on the fears of the Buddhist Pope
until he really believed that Tibet was in danger
of an invasion from India, in which eventuality
the Czar, the great Pan-Buddhist Protector, would
descend on the British and drive them back over
the frontier. The Lamas of Tibet imagine that
Russia is a Buddhist country, and this belief has
been fostered by adventurers like Dorjieff, Tsibikoff,
and others, who have inspired dreams of a
consolidated Buddhist church under the spiritual
control of the Dalai Lama and the military √¶gis
of the Czar of All the Russias.</p>

<p>These dreams, full of political menace to ourselves,
have, I think, been dispelled by Lord
Curzon's timely expedition to Lhasa. The presence
of the British in the capital and the helplessness
of Russia to lend any aid in such a crisis
are facts convincing enough to stultify the effects
of Russian intrigue in Buddhist Central Asia
during the last half-century.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that the first Dalai Lama who has been
allowed to reach maturity has plunged his country
into war by intrigue with a foreign Power proves
the astuteness of the cold-blooded policy of removing
the infant Pope, and the investiture of
power in the hands of a Regent inspired by Peking.
It is believed that the present Dalai Lama was
permitted to come of age in order to throw off
the Chinese yoke. This aim has been secured,
but it has involved other issues that the Lamas
could not foresee.</p>

<p>And here it must be observed that the Dalai
Lama's inclination towards Russia does not represent
any considerable national movement. The
desire for a rapprochement was largely a matter
of personal ambition inspired by that arch-intriguer
Dorjieff, whose ascendancy over the
Dalai Lama was proved beyond a doubt when
the latter joined him in his flight to Mongolia on
hearing the news of the British advance on Lhasa.
Dorjieff had a certain amount of popularity with
the priest population of the capital, and the
monks of the three great monasteries, amongst
whom he is known to have distributed largess
royally. But the traditional policy of isolation
is so inveterately ingrained in the Tibetan character
that it is doubtful if he could have organized
a popular party of any strength.</p>

<p>It may be asked, then, What is, or was, the
nature of the Russian menace in Tibet? It is
true that a Russian invasion on the North-East
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
frontier is out of the question. For to reach the
Indian passes the Russians would have to traverse
nearly 1,500 miles of almost uninhabited country,
presenting difficulties as great as any we had to
contend with during the recent campaign. But
the establishment of Russian influence in Lhasa
might mean military danger of another kind. It
would be easy for her to stir up the Tibetans,
spread disaffection among the Bhutanese, send
secret agents into Nepal, and generally undermine
our prestige. Her aim would be to create a
diversion on the Tibet frontier at any time she
might have designs on the North-West. The
pioneers of the movement had begun their work.
They were men of the usual type&mdash;astute, insidious,
to be disavowed in case of premature discovery, or
publicly flaunted when they had prepared any
ground on which to stand.</p>

<p>Our countermove&mdash;the Tibet Expedition&mdash;must
have been a crushing and unexpected
blow to Russia. For the first time in modern
history Great Britain had taken a decisive,
almost high-handed, step to obviate a danger
that was far from imminent. We had all the
best cards in our hands. Russia's designs in
Lhasa became obvious at a time when we could
point to open defiance on the part of the Tibetans,
and provocation such as would have goaded any
other European nation to a punitive expedition
years before. We could go to Lhasa, apparently
without a thought of Russia, and yet undo all the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
effects of her scheming there, and deal her prestige
a blow that would be felt throughout the whole of
Central Asia. Such was Lord Curzon's policy. It
was adopted in a half-hearted way by the Home
Government, and eventually forced on them by
the conduct of the Tibetans themselves. Needless
to say, the discovery of Russian designs was the
real and prime cause of the despatch of the
mission, while Tibet's violation of treaty rights
and refusal to enter into any relations with us
were convenient as ostensible motives. It cannot
be denied that these grievances were valid enough
to justify the strongest measures.</p>

<p>In June, 1903, came the announcement of
Colonel Younghusband's mission to Khamba Jong.
I do not think that the Indian Government ever
expected that the Tibetans would come to any
agreement with us at Khamba Jong. It is to their
credit that they waited patiently several months
in order to give them every chance of settling
things amicably. However, as might have been
expected, the Commission was boycotted. Irresponsible
delegates of inferior rank were sent by
the Tibetans and Chinese, and the Lhasa delegates,
after some fruitless parleyings, shut themselves
up in the fort, and declined all intercourse,
official or social, with the Commissioners.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of August news came that the
Tibetans were arming. Colonel Younghusband
learnt that they had made up their minds to have
no negociations with us <i>inside</i> Tibet. They had
decided to leave us alone at Khamba Jong, and to
oppose us by force if we attempted to advance
further. They believed themselves fully equal to
the English, and far from our getting anything
out of them, they thought that they would be
able to force something out of us. This is not
surprising when we consider the spirit of concession
in which we had met them on previous occasions.</p>

<p>At Khamba Jong the Commissioners were informed
by Colonel Chao, the Chinese delegate,
that the Tibetans were relying on Russian assistance.
This was confirmed later at Guru by the
Tibetan officials, who boasted that if they were
defeated they would fall back on another Power.</p>

<p>In September the Tibetans aggravated the
situation by seizing and beating at Shigatze two
British subjects of the Lachung Valley in Sikkim.
These men were not restored to liberty until we
had forced our way to Lhasa and demanded their
liberation, twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>The mission remained in its ignominious position
at Khamba Jong until its recall in November.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Almost at the same time the expedition to Gyantse
was announced.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In the face of the gross and deliberate affront
to which we had been subjected at Khamba Jong
it was now, of course, impossible to withdraw
from Tibetan territory until we had impressed
on the Lamas the necessity of meeting us in a
reasonable spirit. It was clear that the Tibetans
meant fighting, and the escort had to be increased
to 2,500 men. The patience of Government was
at last exhausted, and it was decided that the
mission was to proceed into Tibet, dictate terms
to the Lamas, and, if necessary, enforce compliance.
The advance to Gyantse was sanctioned
in the first place. But it was quite expected that
the obstinacy of the Tibetans would make it
necessary to push on to Lhasa.</p>

<p>Colonel Younghusband crossed the Jelap la into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Tibet on December 13, meeting with no opposition.
Phari Jong was reached on the 20th, and the fort
surrendered without a shot being fired. Thence
the mission proceeded on January 7 across the
Tang Pass, and took up its quarters on the cold,
wind-swept plateau of Tuna, at an elevation of
15,300 feet. Here it remained for three months,
while preparations were being made for an advance
in the spring. Four companies of the 23rd
Pioneers, a machine-gun section of the Norfolk
Regiment, and twenty Madras sappers, were left
to garrison the place, and General Macdonald, with
the remainder of the force, returned to Chumbi for
winter quarters. Chumbi (10,060 feet) is well
within the wood belt, but even here the thermometer
falls to 15¬∞ below zero.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fp020"></a><a href="images/fp020.jpg">
<img src="images/fp020s.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />Tuna Village.</span>
</div>

<p>A more miserable place to winter in than Tuna
cannot be imagined. But for political reasons, it
was inadvisable that the mission should spend
the winter in the Chumbi Valley, which is not
geographically a part of Tibet proper. A retrograde
movement from Khamba Jong to Chumbi
would be interpreted by the Tibetans as a sign
of yielding, and strengthen them in their opinion
that we had no serious intention of penetrating
to Gyantse.</p>

<p>With this brief account of the facts that led to
the expedition I abandon politics for the present,
and in the succeeding chapters will attempt to
give a description of the Chumbi Valley, which,
I believe, was untrodden by any European before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Colonel Younghusband's arrival in December,
1903.</p>

<p>I was in India when I received permission to
join the force. I took the train to Darjeeling
without losing a day, and rode into Chumbi in
less than forty-eight hours, reaching the British
camp on January 10.</p>

<small>OVER THE FRONTIER</small></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Chumbi</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>January</i> 13.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Darjeeling to Lhasa is 380 miles. These,
as in the dominions of Namgay Doola's Raja, are
mostly on end. The road crosses the Tibetan
frontier at the Jelap la (14,350 feet) eighty miles
to the north-east. From Observatory Hill in
Darjeeling one looks over the bleak hog-backed
ranges of Sikkim to the snows. To the north and
north-west lie Kinchenjunga and the tremendous
chain of mountains that embraces Everest. To
the north-east stretches a lower line of dazzling
rifts and spires, in which one can see a thin gray
wedge, like a slice in a Christmas cake. That is
the Jelap. Beyond it lies Tibet.</p>

<p>There is a good military road from Siliguri, the
base station in the plains to Rungpo, forty-eight
miles along the Teesta Valley. By following the
river-bed it avoids the two steep ascents to Kalimpong
and Ari. The new route saves at least a
day, and conveys one to Rungli, nearly seventy
miles from the base, without compassing a single
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
tedious incline. It has also the advantage of
being practicable for bullock-carts and ekkas as
far as Rungpo. After that the path is a 6-foot
mule-track, at its best a rough, dusty incline, at
its worst a succession of broken rocks and frozen
puddles, which give no foothold to transport
animals. From Rungpo the road skirts the stream
for sixteen miles to Rungli, along a fertile valley
of some 2,000 feet, through rice-fields and orange-groves
and peaceful villages, now the scene of
military bustle and preparation. From Rungli it
follows a winding mountain torrent, whose banks
are sometimes sheer precipitous crags. Then it
strikes up the mountain side, and becomes a
ladder of stone steps over which no animal in
the world can make more than a mile and a half
an hour. From the valley to Gnatong is a climb
of some 10,000 feet without a break. The scenery
is most magnificent, and I doubt if it is possible
to find anywhere in the same compass the characteristics
of the different zones of vegetation&mdash;from
tropical to temperate, from temperate to alpine&mdash;so
beautifully exhibited.</p>

<p>At ordinary seasons transport is easy, and one
can take the road in comfort; but now every mule
and pony in Sikkim and the Terai is employed on
the lines of communication, and one has to pay
300 rupees for an animal of the most modest pretensions.
It is reckoned eight days from Darjeeling
to Chumbi, but, riding all day and most
of the night, I completed the journey in two.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Newspaper correspondents are proverbially in a
hurry. To send the first wire from Chumbi I
had to leave my kit behind, and ride with poshteen<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and sleeping-bag tied to my saddle. I was
racing another correspondent. At Rungpo I
found that he was five hours ahead of me, but he
rested on the road, and I had gained three hours
on him before he left the next stage at Rora
Thang. Here I learnt that he intended to camp
at Lingtam, twelve miles further on, in a tent
lent him by a transport officer. I made up my
mind to wait outside Lingtam until it was dark,
and then to steal a march on him unobserved.
But I believed no one. Wayside reports were
probably intended to deceive me, and no doubt
my informant was his unconscious confederate.</p>

<p>Outside Rungli, six miles further on, I stopped
at a little Bhutia's hut, where he had been resting.
They told me he had gone on only half an hour
before me. I loitered on the road, and passed
Lingtam in the dark. The moon did not rise till
three, and riding in the dark was exciting. At
first the white dusty road showed clearly enough
a few yards ahead, but after passing Lingtam it
became a narrow path cut out of a thickly-wooded
cliff above a torrent, a wall of rock on one side, a
precipice on the other. Here the darkness was
intense. A white stone a few yards ahead looked
like the branch of a tree overhead. A dim shapeless
object to the left might be a house, a rock, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
bear&mdash;anything. Uphill and downhill could only
be distinguished by the angle of the saddle.
Every now and then a firefly lit up the white
precipice an arm's-length to the right. Once
when my pony stopped panting with exhaustion
I struck a match and found that we had come to
a sharp zigzag. Part of the revetment had fallen;
there was a yard of broken path covered with fern
and bracken, then a drop of some hundred feet to
the torrent below. After that I led my beast for
a mile until we came to a charcoal-burner's hut.
Two or three Bhutias were sitting round a log
fire, and I persuaded one to go in front of me with
a lighted brand. So we came to Sedongchen,
where I left my beast dead beat, rested a few hours,
bought a good mule, and pressed on in the early
morning by moonlight. The road to Gnatong lies
through a magnificent forest of oak and chestnut.
For five miles it is nothing but the ascent of stone
steps I have described. Then the rhododendron
zone is reached, and one passes through a forest of
gnarled and twisted trunks, writhing and contorted
as if they had been thrust there for some penance.
The place suggested a scene from Dante's 'Inferno.'
As I reached the saddle of Lingtu the
moon was paling, and the eastern sky-line became
a faint violet screen. In a few minutes Kinchenjunga
and Kabru on the north-west caught the
first rays of the sun, and were suffused with the
delicate rosy glow of dawn.</p>

<p>I reached Gnatong in time to breakfast with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the 8th Gurkhas. The camp lies in a little cleft
in the hills at an elevation of 12,200 feet. When
I last visited the place I thought it one of the
most desolate spots I had seen. My first impressions
were a wilderness of gray stones and gray,
uninhabited houses, felled tree-trunks denuded of
bark, white and spectral on the hillside. There
was no life, no children's voices or chattering
women, no bazaar apparently, no dogs barking,
not even a pariah to greet you. If there was a
sound of life it was the bray of some discontented
mule searching for stray blades of grass among
the stones. There were some fifty houses nearly
all smokeless and vacant. Some had been barracks
at the time of the last Sikkim War, and of
the soldiers who inhabited them fifteen still lay
in Gnatong in a little gray cemetery, which was
the first indication of the nearness of human life.
The inscriptions over the graves were all dated
1888, 1889, or 1890, and though but fourteen
years had passed, many of them were barely
decipherable. The houses were scattered about
promiscuously, with no thought of neighbourliness
or convenience, as though the people were
living there under protest, which was very probably
the case. But the place had its picturesque
feature. You might mistake some of the houses
for tumbledown Swiss ch√¢lets of the poorer sort
were it not for the miniature fir-trees planted on
the roofs, with their burdens of prayers hanging
from the branches like parcels on a Christmas-tree.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>These were my impressions a year or two
ago, but now Gnatong is all life and bustle. In
the bazaar a convoy of 300 mules was being
loaded. The place was crowded with Nepalese
coolies and Tibetan drivers, picturesque in their
woollen knee-boots of red and green patterns,
with a white star at the foot, long russet cloaks
bound tightly at the waist and bulging out with
cooking-utensils and changes of dress, embroidered
caps of every variety and description, as often as
not tied to the head by a wisp of hair. In Rotten
Row&mdash;the inscription of 1889 still remains&mdash;I met
a subaltern with a pair of skates. He showed me
to the mess-room, where I enjoyed a warm breakfast
and a good deal of chaff about correspondents
who 'were in such a devil of a hurry to get to a
God-forsaken hole where there wasn't going to be
the ghost of a show.'</p>

<p>I left Gnatong early on a borrowed pony. A
mile and a half from the camp the road crosses
the Tuko Pass, and one descends again for another
two miles to Kapup, a temporary transport stage.
The path lies to the west of the Bidang Tso, a
beautiful lake with a moraine at the north-west
side. The mountains were strangely silent, and
the only sound of wild life was the whistling of the
red-billed choughs, the commonest of the <i>Corvid√¶</i>
at these heights. They were flying round and
round the lake in an unsettled manner, whistling
querulously, as though in complaint at the intrusion
of their solitude.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>I reached the Jelap soon after noon. No snow
had fallen. The approach was over broken rock
and shale. At the summit was a row of cairns,
from which fluttered praying-flags and tattered bits
of votive raiment. Behind us and on both sides
was a thin mist, but in front my eyes explored
a deep narrow valley bathed in sunshine. Here,
then, was Tibet, the forbidden, the mysterious.
In the distance all the land was that yellow and
brick-dust colour I had often seen in pictures
and thought exaggerated and unreal. Far to the
north-east Chumulari (23,930 feet), with its magnificent
white spire rising from the roof-like mass
behind, looked like an immense cathedral of snow.
Far below on a yellow hillside hung the Kanjut
Lamasery above Rinchengong. In the valley
beneath lay Chumbi and the road to Lhasa.</p>

<p>There is a descent of over 4,000 feet in six miles
from the summit of the Jelap. The valley is
perfectly straight, without a bend, so that one
can look down from the pass upon the Kanjut
monastery on the hillside immediately above
Yatung. The pass would afford an impregnable
military position to a people with the rudiments
of science and martial spirit. A few riflemen on
the cliffs that command it might annihilate a
column with perfect safety, and escape into
Bhutan before any flanking movement could be
made. Yet miles of straggling convoy are allowed
to pass daily with the supplies that are necessary
for the existence of the force ahead. The road to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Phari Jong passes through two military walls.
The first at Yatung, six miles below the pass, is
a senseless obstruction, and any able-bodied
Tommy with hobnailed boots might very easily
kick it down. It has no block-houses, and would
be useless against a flank attack. Before our
advance to Chumbi the wall was inhabited by
three Chinese officials, a dingpon, or Tibetan
sergeant, and twenty Tibetan soldiers. It served
as a barrier beyond which no British subject was
allowed to pass. The second wall lies across the
valley at Gob-sorg, four miles beyond our camp
at Chumbi. It is roofed and loop-holed like the
Yatung barrier, and is defended by block-houses.
This fortification and every mile of valley between
the Jelap and Gautsa might be held by a single
company against an invading force. Yet there
are not half a dozen Chinese or Tibetan soldiers
in the valley. No opposition is expected this side
of the Tang la, but nondescript troops armed with
matchlocks and bows hover round the mission on
the open plateau beyond. Our evacuation of
Khamba Jong and occupation of Chumbi were so
rapid and unexpected that it is thought the
Tibetans had no time to bring troops into the
valley; but to anyone who knows their strategical
incompetence, no explanation is necessary.</p>

<p>Yatung is reached by one of the worst sections
of road on the march; one comes across a dead
transport mule at almost every zigzag of the
descent. For ten years the village has enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the distinction of being the only place in Southern
Tibet accessible to Europeans. Not that many
Europeans avail themselves of its accessibility,
for it is a dreary enough place to live in, shrouded
as it is in cloud more than half the year round,
and embedded in a valley so deep and narrow
that in winter-time the sun has hardly risen
above one cliff when it sinks behind another.
The privilege of access to Yatung was the result
of the agreement between Great Britain and
China with regard to trade communications between
India and Tibet drawn up in Darjeeling
in 1893, subsequently to the Sikkim Convention.
It was then stipulated that there should be a trade
mart at Yatung to which British subjects should
have free access, and that there should be special
trade facilities between Sikkim and Tibet. It is
reported that the Chinese Amban took good care
that Great Britain should not benefit by these new
regulations, for after signing the agreement which
was to give the Indian tea-merchants a market in
Tibet, he introduced new regulations the other
side of the frontier, which prohibited the purchase
of Indian tea. Whether the story is true or not,
it is certainly characteristic of the evasion and
duplicity which have brought about the present
armed mission into Tibet.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />On the Road to Gautsa.</span>
</div>

<p>To-day, as one rides through the cobbled
street of Yatung, the only visible effects of the
Convention are the Chinese Customs House with
its single European officer, and the residence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of a lady missionary, or trader, as the exigencies
of international diplomacy oblige her to term
herself. The Customs House, which was opened
on May 1, 1894, was first established with the
object of estimating the trade between India
and Tibet&mdash;traffic is not permitted by any
other route than the Jelap&mdash;and with a view to
taxation when the trade should make it worth
while. It was stipulated that no duties should
be levied for the period of five years. Up to the
present no tariff has been imposed, and the only
apparent use the Customs House serves is to
collect statistics, and perhaps to remind Tibet of
the shadowy suzerainty of China. The natives
have boycotted the place, and refuse to trade
there, and no European or native of India has
thought it worth while to open a market. Phari
is the real trade mart on the frontier, and Kalimpong,
in British Bhutan, is the foreign trade mart.
But the whole trade between India and Tibet is
on such a small scale that it might be in the hands
of a single merchant.</p>

<p>The Customs House, the missionary house, and
the houses of the clerks and servants of the
Customs and of the headman, form a little block.
Beyond it there is a quarter of a mile of barren
stony ground, and then the wall with military
pretensions. I rode through the gate unchallenged.</p>

<p>At Rinchengong, a mile beyond the barrier, the
Yatung stream flows into the Ammo Chu. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
road follows the eastern bank of the river, passing
through Cheuma and Old Chumbi, where it crosses
the stream. After crossing the bridge, a mile of
almost level ground takes one into Chumbi camp.
I reached Chumbi on the evening of January 12,
and was able to send the <i>Daily Mail</i> the first
cable from Tibet, having completed the journey
from Darjeeling in two days' hard riding.</p>

<p>The camp lies in a shallow basin in the hills, and
is flanked by brown fir-clad hills which rise some
1,500 feet above the river-bed, and preclude a
view of the mountains on all sides. The situation
is by no means the best from the view of
comfort, but strategic reasons make it necessary,
for if the camp were pitched half a mile further
up the valley, the gorge of the stream which
debouches into the Ammo River to the north of
Chumbi would give the Tibetans an opportunity
of attacking us in the rear. Despite the protection
of almost Arctic clothing, one shivers until
the sun rises over the eastern hill at ten o'clock,
and shivers again when it sinks behind the opposite
one at three. Icy winds sweep the valley,
and hurricanes of dust invade one's tent. Against
this cold one clothes one's self in flannel vest and
shirt, sweater, flannel-lined coat, poshteen or
Cashmere sheepskin, wool-lined Gilgit boots, and
fur or woollen cap with flaps meeting under the
chin. The general effect is barbaric and picturesque.
In after-days the trimness of a military
club may recall the scene&mdash;officers clad in gold-embroidered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
poshteen, yellow boots, and fur caps,
bearded like wild Kerghizes, and huddling round
the camp fire in this black cauldron-like valley
under the stars.</p>

<p>Officers are settling down in Chumbi as comfortably
as possible for winter quarters. Primitive
dens have been dug out of the ground, walled
up with boulders, and roofed in with green fir-branches.
In some cases a natural rock affords
a whole wall. The den where I am now writing
is warmed by a cheerful pinewood blaze, a luxury
after the <i>angeiti</i> in one's tent. I write at an
operating-table after a dinner of minal (pheasant)
and yak's heart. A gramophone is dinning in
my ears. It is destined, I hope, to resound in
the palace of Potala, where the Dalai Lama and
his suite may wonder what heathen ritual is
accompanied by 'A jovial monk am I,' and 'Her
golden hair was hanging down her back.'</p>

<p>Both at home and in India one hears the Tibet
Mission spoken of enviously as a picnic. There
is an idea of an encampment in a smiling valley,
and easy marches towards the mysterious city.
In reality, there is plenty of hard and uninteresting
work. The expedition is attended with all
the discomforts of a campaign, and very little of
the excitement. Colonel Younghusband is now
at Tuna, a desolate hamlet on the Tibetan plateau,
exposed to the coldest winds of Asia, where the
thermometer falls to 25¬∞ below zero. Detachments
of the escort are scattered along the line
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of communications in places of varying cold and
discomfort, where they must wait until the necessary
supplies have been carried through to Phari.
It is not likely that Colonel Younghusband will
be able to proceed to Gyantse before March. In
the meanwhile, imagine the Pioneers and Gurkhas,
too cold to wash or shave, shivering in a dirty
Tibetan fort, half suffocated with smoke from a
yak-dung fire. Then there is the transport officer
shut up in some narrow valley of Sikkim, trying
to make half a dozen out of three with his camp
of sick beasts and sheaf of urgent telegrams calling
for supplies. He hopes there will be 'a show,'
and that he may be in it. Certainly if anyone
deserves to go to Lhasa and get a medal for it,
it is the supply and transport man. But he will
be left behind.</p>

<small>THE CHUMBI VALLEY</small></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Chumbi</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>February, 1904</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chumbi Valley is inhabited by the Tomos,
who are said to be descendants of ancient cross-marriages
between the Bhutanese and Lepchas.
They only intermarry among themselves, and speak
a language which would not be understood in other
parts of Tibet. As no Tibetan proper is allowed
to pass the Yatung barrier, the Tomos have the
monopoly of the carrying trade between Phari and
Kalimpong. They are voluntarily under the protection
of the Tibetans, who treat them liberally,
as the Lamas realize the danger of their geographical
position as a buffer state, and are shrewd
enough to recognise that any ill treatment or
oppression would drive them to seek protection
from the Bhutanese or British.</p>

<p>The Tomos are merry people, hearty, and good-natured.
They are wonderfully hardy and enduring.
In the coldest winter months, when the
thermometer is 20¬∞ below zero, they will camp
out at night in the snow, forming a circle of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
their loads, and sleep contentedly inside with no
tent or roofing. The women would be comely if
it were not for the cutch that they smear over
their faces. The practice is common to the
Tibetans and Bhutanese, but no satisfactory reason
has been found for it. The Jesuit Father, Johann
Grueber, who visited Tibet in 1661, attributed the
custom to a religious whim:&mdash;'The women, out of
a religious whim, never wash, but daub themselves
with a nasty kind of oil, which not only causes
them to stink intolerably, but renders them extremely
ugly and deformed.' A hundred and
eighty years afterwards Huc noticed the same
habit, and attributed it to an edict issued by the
Dalai Lama early in the seventeenth century.
'The women of Tibet in those days were much
given to dress, and libertinage, and corrupted the
Lamas to a degree to bring their holy order into a
bad repute.' The then Nome Khan (deputy of the
Dalai Lama), accordingly issued an order that the
women should never appear in public without
smearing their faces with a black disfiguring paste.
Huc recorded that though the order was still
obeyed, the practice was observed without much
benefit to morals. If you ask a Tomo or Tibetan
to-day why their women smear and daub themselves
in this unbecoming manner, they invariably
reply, like the Mussulman or Hindu, that it is
custom. Mongolians do not bother themselves
about causes.</p>

<p>The Tomo women wear a flat green distinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
cap, with a red badge in the front, which harmonizes
with their complexion&mdash;a coarse, brick red, of which
the primal ingredients are dirt and cutch, erroneously
called pig's blood, and the natural ruddiness
of a healthy outdoor life in a cold climate.
A procession of these sirens is comely and picturesque&mdash;at
a hundred yards. They wrap themselves
round and round with a thick woollen
blanket of pleasing colour and pattern, and wear
on their feet high woollen boots with leather or
rope soles. If it was not for their disfiguring toilet
many of them would be handsome. The children
are generally pretty, and I have seen one or two
that were really beautiful. When we left a camp
the villagers would generally get wind of it, and
come down for loot. Old newspapers, tins, bottles,
string, and cardboard boxes were treasured prizes.
We threw these out of our cave, and the children
scrambled for them, and even the women made
dives at anything particularly tempting. My last
impression of Lingmathang was a group of women
giggling and gesticulating over the fashion plates
and advertisements in a number of the <i>Lady</i>, which
somebody's <i>memsahib</i> had used for the packing of
a ham.</p>

<p>The Tomos, though not naturally given to cleanliness,
realize the hygienic value of their hot springs.
There are resorts in the neighbourhood of Chumbi
as fashionable as Homburg or Salsomaggiore;
mixed bathing is the rule, without costumes.
These healthy folk are not morbidly conscious of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
sex. The springs contain sulphur and iron, and
are undoubtedly efficacious. Where they are not
hot enough, the Tomos bake large boulders in the
ashes of a log fire, and roll them into the water to
increase the temperature.</p>

<p>Tomos and Tibetans are fond of smoking. They
dry the leaves of the wild rhubarb, and mix them
with tobacco leaves. The mixture is called <i>dopta</i>,
and was the favourite blend of the country.
Now hundreds of thousands of cheap American
cigarettes are being introduced, and a lucrative
tobacco-trade has sprung up. Boxes of ten, which
are sold at a pice in Darjeeling, fetch an anna at
Chumbi, and two annas at Phari. Sahibs smoke
them, sepoys smoke them, drivers and followers
smoke them, and the Tomo coolies smoke nothing
else. Tibetan children of three appreciate them
hugely, and the road from Phari to Rungpo is literally
strewn with the empty boxes.</p>

<p>There is a considerable Chinese element in the
Chumbi Valley&mdash;a frontier officer, with the local
rank of the Fourth Button, a colonel, clerks of the
Customs House, and troops numbering from one
to two hundred. These, of course, were not in
evidence when we occupied the valley in December.
The Chinese are not accompanied by their wives,
but take to themselves women of the country,
whose offspring people the so-called Chinese
villages. The pure Chinaman does not remain in
the country after his term of office. Life at
Chumbi is the most tedious exile to him, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
looks down on the Tomos as barbarous savages.
He is as unhappy as a Frenchman in Tonquin, cut
off from all the diversions of social and intellectual
life. The frontier officer at Bibi-thang told me
that he had brought his wife with him, and the
poor lady had never left the house, but cried incessantly
for China and civilization. Yet to the uninitiated
the Chinese villages of Gob-sorg and Bibi-thang
might have been taken from the far East
and plumped down on the Indian frontier. There
is the same far-Eastern smell, the same doss-house,
the same hanging lamps, the same red lucky paper
over the lintels of the doors, and the same red and
green abortions on the walls.</p>

<p>Much has been written and duly contradicted
about the fertility of the Chumbi Valley. If one
does not expect orange-groves and rice-fields at
12,000 feet, it must be admitted that the valley
is, relatively speaking, fertile&mdash;that is to say, its
produce is sufficient to support its three or four
thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>The lower valley produces buckwheat, turnips,
potatoes, radishes, and barley. The latter, the
staple food of the Tibetans, has, when ground, an
appetizing smell very like oatmeal. The upper
valley is quite sterile, and produces nothing but
barley, which does not ripen; it is gathered for
fodder when green, and the straw is sold at high
prices to the merchants who visit Phari from Tibet
and Bhutan. This year the Tibetan merchants are
afraid to come, and the commissariat benefits by a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
very large supply of fodder which ought to see them
through the summer.</p>

<p>The idea that the valley is unusually fertile
probably arose from the well-to-do appearance of
the natives of Rinchengong and Chumbi, and their
almost palatial houses, which give evidence of a
prosperity due to trade rather than agriculture.</p>

<p>The hillsides around Chumbi produce wild strawberries,
raspberries, currants, and cherries; but these
are quite insipid in this sunless climate.</p>

<p>The Chinese Custom's officer at Yatung tells
me that the summer months, though not hot, are
relaxing and enervating. The thermometer never
rises above 70¬∞. The rainfall does not average
quite 50 inches; but almost daily at noon a mist
creeps up from Bhutan, and a constant drizzle falls.
In June, July, and August, 1901, there were only
three days without rain.</p>

<p>At Phari I met a venerable old gentleman who
gave me some statistics. The old man, Katsak
Kasi by name, was a Tibetan from the Kham
province, acting at Phari as trade agent for the
Bhutanese Government. His face was seared and
parchment-like from long exposure to cold winds
and rough weather. His features were comparatively
aquiline&mdash;that is to say, they did not look
as if they had been flattened out in youth. He
wore a very large pair of green spectacles, with a
gold bulb at each end and a red tassel in the
middle, which gave him an air of wisdom and distinction.
He answered my rather inquisitive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41/42]</a></span>
questions with courtesy and decision, and yet with
such a serious care for details that I felt quite sure
his figures must be accurate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="p041"></a><a href="images/p041.jpg">
<img src="images/p041s.jpg" alt="Page 41." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />Rock Sculpturers.</span>
</div>

<p>If statistics were any gauge of the benefits Indian
trade would derive from an open market with Tibet,
the present mission, as far as commercial interests
are concerned, would be wasted. According to
Kasi's statistics, the cost of two dozen or thirty
mules would balance the whole of the annual
revenue on Indian imports into the country. The
idea that duties are levied at the Yatung and Gob-sorg
barriers is a mistake. The only Customs
House is at Phari, where the Indian and Bhutanese
trade-routes meet. The Customs are under the
supervision of the two jongpens, who send the
revenue to Lhasa twice a year.</p>

<p>The annual income on imports from India, Kasi
assured me, is only 6,000 rupees, whereas the income
on exports amounts to 20,000. Tibetan
trade with India consists almost entirely of wool,
yaks'-tails, and ponies. There is a tax of 2 rupees
8 annas on ponies, 1 rupee a maund on wool, and
1 rupee 8 annas a maund on yaks'-tails. Our imports
into Tibet, according to Kasi's statistics, are
practically nil. Some piece goods, iron vessels, and
tobacco leaves find their way over the Jelap, but
it is a common sight to see mules returning into
Tibet with nothing but their drivers' cooking
utensils and warm clothing.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>At present no Indian tea passes Yatung. That
none is sold at Phari confirms the rumour I mentioned
that the Chinese Amban, after signing the
trade regulations between India and Tibet in Darjeeling,
1893, crossed the frontier to introduce new
laws, virtually annulling the regulations. Indian
tea might be carried into Tibet, but not sold there.
Tibet has consistently broken all her promises and
treaty obligations. She has placed every obstacle
in the way of Indian trade, and insulted our Commissioners;
yet the despatch of the present mission
with its armed escort has been called an act of
aggression.</p>

<p>When I asked Kasi if the Tibetans would be
angry with him for helping us, he said they would
certainly cut off his head if he remained in the fort
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
after we had left. There is some foundation in
travellers' stories about the punishment inflicted on
the guards of the passes and other officials who fail
to prevent Europeans entering Tibet or pushing on
towards Lhasa.</p>

<p>Some Chumbi traders who were in Lhasa when
we entered the valley are still detained there, as far
as I can gather, as hostages for the good behaviour
of their neighbours. In Tibet the punishment does
not fit the crime. The guards of a pass are punished
for letting white men through, quite irrespective of
the opposing odds.</p>

<p>The commonest punishment in Tibet is flogging,
but the ordeal is so severe that it often proves fatal.
I asked Kasi some questions about the magisterial
powers of the two jongpens, or district officers, who
remained in the fort some days after we occupied
it. He told me that they could not pass capital
sentence, but they might flog the prisoners, and if
they died, nothing was said. Several victims have
died of flogging at Phari.</p>

<p>The natives in Darjeeling have a story of
Tibetan methods, which have always seemed to me
the refinement of cruelty. At Gyantse, they say,
the criminal is flung into a dark pit, where he
cannot tell whether it is night or day. Cobras and
scorpions and reptiles of various degrees of venom
are his companions; these he may hear in the darkness,
for it is still enough, and seek or avoid as he
has courage. Food is sometimes thrown in to
tempt any faint-hearted wretch to prolong his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
agony. I asked Kasi if there were any truth in
the tale. He told me that there were no venomous
snakes in Tibet, but he had heard that there was a
dark prison in Gyantse, where criminals sometimes
died of scorpion bites; he added that only the
worst offenders were punished in this way. The
modified version of the story is gruesome enough.</p>

<p>It is usual for Tibetan and Bhutanese officials
to receive their pay in grain, it being understood
that their position puts them in the way of obtaining
the other necessaries of life, and perhaps a few
of its luxuries. Kasi, being an important official,
receives from the Bhutan Government forty maunds
of barley and forty maunds of rice annually. He
receives, in addition, a commission on the trade
disputes that he decides in proportion to their importance.
He is now an invaluable servant of the
British Government. At his nod the barren solitudes
round Phari are wakening into life. From
the fort bastions one sees sometimes on the hills
opposite an indistinct black line, like a caterpillar
gradually assuming shape. They are Kasi's yaks
coming from some blind valley which no one but a
hunter or mountaineer would have imagined to
exist. Ponies, grain, and fodder are also imported
from Bhutan and sold to the mutual gratification
of the Bhutanese and ourselves. The yaks are
hired and employed on the line of communications.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the Bhutanese, when they
hear of our good prices, will send supplies over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
frontier to hasten our advance. But we must take
care than no harm befalls Kasi for his good <ins class="corr" title="services,">services.</ins>
When I asked him how he stood with the Tibetan
Government, he laid his hand in a significant
manner across his throat.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">LINGMATHANG</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>February</i>.</span></p>

<p>Before entering the bare, unsheltered plateau
of Tibet, the road to Lhasa winds through seven
miles of pine forest, which recalls some of the most
beautiful valleys of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The wood-line ends abruptly. After that there
is nothing but barrenness and desolation. The
country round Chumbi is not very thickly forested.
There are long strips of arable land on each side of
the road, and villages every two or three miles.
The fields are terraced and enclosed within stone
walls. Scattered on the hillside are stone-built
houses, with low, over-hanging eaves, and long
wooden tiles, each weighed down with a gray
boulder. One might imagine one's self in Kandersteg
or Lauterbrunnen; only lofty praying flags
and <i>mani</i>-walls brightly painted with Buddhistic
pictures and inscriptions dispel the illusion.</p>

<p>There is no lack of colour. In the winter months
a brier with large red berries and a low, foxy-brown
thornbush, like a young osier in March, lend
a russet hue to the landscape. Higher on the hills
the withered grass is yellow, and the blending of
these quiet tints, russet, brown, and yellow, gives
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the valley a restful beauty; but in cloud it is
sombre enough.</p>

<p>Three years ago I visited Yatung in May. In
springtime there is a profusion of colour. The
valley is beautiful, beyond the beauty of the
grandest Alpine scenery, carpeted underfoot with
spring flowers, and ablaze overhead with flowering
rhododendrons. To try to describe mountains and
forests is a most unprofitable task; all the adjectives
of scenic description are exhausted; the
coinage has been too long debased. For my own
part, it has been almost a pain to visit the most
beautiful parts of the earth and to know that one's
sensations are incommunicable, that it is impossible
to make people believe and understand. To those
who have not seen, scenery is either good, bad,
or indifferent; there are no degrees. Ruskin, the
greatest master of description, is most entertaining
when he is telling us about the domestic circle at
Herne Hill. But mountain scenery is of all the
most difficult to describe. The sense of the
Himalayas is intangible. There are elusive lights
and shades, and sounds and whispers, and unfamiliar
scents, and a thousand fleeting manifestations
of the genius of the place that are impossible
to arrest. Magnificent, majestic, splendid, are
weak, colourless words that depict nothing. It is
the poets who have described what they have not
seen who have been most successful. Milton's
hell is as real as any landscape of Byron's, and the
country through which Childe Roland rode to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the Dark Tower is more vivid and present to us
than any of Wordsworth's Westmoreland tarns
and valleys. So it is a poem of the imagination&mdash;'Kubla
Khan'&mdash;that seems to me to breathe something
of the spirit of the Yatung and Chumbi
Valleys, only there is a little less of mystery and
gloom here, and a little more of sunshine and
brightness than in the dream poem. Instead of
attempting to describe the valley&mdash;Paradise would
be easier to describe&mdash;I will try to explain as
logically as possible why it fascinated me more
than any scenery I have seen.</p>

<p>I had often wondered if there were any place
in the East where flowers grow in the same profusion
as in Europe&mdash;in England, or in Switzerland.
The nearest approach I had seen was in the
plateau of the Southern Shan States, at about
4,000 feet, where the flora is very homelike. But
the ground is not <i>carpeted</i>; one could tread without
crushing a blossom. Flowers are plentiful, too,
on the southern slopes of the Himalayas, and on
the hills on the Siamese side of the Tennasserim
frontier, but I had seen nothing like a field of
marsh-marigolds and cuckoo-flowers in May, or
a meadow of buttercups and daisies, or a bank of
primroses, or a wood carpeted with bluebells, or a
hillside with heather, or an Alpine slope with
gentians and ranunculus. I had been told that
in Persia in springtime the valleys of the Shapur
River and the Karun are covered profusely with
lilies, also the forests of Manchuria in the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of the Great White Mountain; but until
I crossed the Jelapla and struck down the valley
to Yatung I thought I would have to go West
to see such things again. Never was such profusion.
Besides the primulas<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;I counted eight
different kinds of them&mdash;and gentians and anemones
and celandines and wood sorrel and wild strawberries
and irises, there were the rhododendrons
glowing like coals through the pine forest. As one
descended the scenery became more fascinating;
the valley narrowed, and the stream was more
boisterous. Often the cliffs hung sheer over the
water's edge; the rocks were coated with green
and yellow moss, which formed a bed for the dwarf
rhododendron bushes, now in full flower, white and
crimson and cream, and every hue between a dark
reddish brown and a light sulphury yellow&mdash;not
here and there, but everywhere, jostling one
another for nooks and crannies in the rock.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>These delicate flowers are very different from
their dowdy cousin, the coarse red rhododendron
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of the English shrubbery. At a little distance
they resemble more hothouse azaleas, and equal
them in wealth of blossom.</p>

<p>The great moss-grown rocks in the bed of the
stream were covered with equal profusion. Looking
behind, the snows crowned the pine-trees, and
over them rested the blue sky. And here is the
second reason&mdash;as I am determined to be logical
in my preference&mdash;why I found the valley so
fascinating. In contrasting the Himalayas with
the Alps, there is always something that the
former is without. Never the snows, and the
water, and the greenery at the same time; if
the greenery is at your feet, the snows are far
distant; where the Himalayas gain in grandeur
they lose in beauty. So I thought the wild valley
of Lauterbrunnen, lying at the foot of the Jungfrau,
the perfection of Alpine scenery until I saw the
valley of Yatung, a pine-clad mountain glen,
green as a hawthorn hedge in May, as brilliantly
variegated as a beechwood copse in autumn, and
culminating in the snowy peak that overhangs the
Jelapla. The valley has besides an intangible
fascination, indescribable because it is illogical.
Certainly the light that played upon all these
colours seemed to me softer than everyday sunshine;
and the opening spring foliage of larch and
birch and mountain ash seemed more delicate and
varied than on common ground. Perhaps it was
that I was approaching the forbidden land. But
what irony, that this seductive valley should be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the approach to the most bare and unsheltered
country in Asia!</p>

<p>Even now, in February, I can detect a few
salmon-coloured leaf-buds, which remind me that
the month of May will be a revelation to the
mission force, when their veins are quickened by
the unfamiliar warmth, and their eyes dazzled by
this unexpected treasure which is now germinating
in the brown earth.</p>

<p>Four miles beyond Chumbi the road passes
through the second military wall at the Chinese
village of Gob-sorg. Riding through the quiet
gateway beneath the grim, hideous figure of the
goddess Dolma carved on the rock above, one
feels a silent menace. One is part of more than a
material invasion; one has passed the gate that has
been closed against the profane for centuries; one
has committed an irretrievable step. Goddess and
barrier are symbols of Tibet's spiritual and material
agencies of opposition. We have challenged and
defied both. We have entered the arena now, and
are to be drawn into the vortex of all that is most
sacred and hidden, to struggle there with an implacable
foe, who is protected by the elemental
forces of nature.</p>

<p>Inside the wall, above the road, stands the
Chinese village of Gob-sorg. The Chinamen come
out of their houses and stand on the revetment to
watch us pass. They are as quiet and ugly as their
gods. They gaze down on our convoys and modern
contrivances with a silent contempt that implies a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
consciousness of immemorial superiority. Who can
tell what they think or what they wish, these undivinable
creatures? They love money, we know,
and they love something else that we cannot know.
It is not country, or race, or religion, but an inscrutable
something that may be allied to these
things, that induces a mental obstinacy, an unfathomable
reserve which may conceal a wisdom
beyond our philosophy or mere callousness and
indifference. The thing is there, though it has no
European name or definition. It has caused many
curious and unexplained outbreaks in different
parts of the world, and it is no doubt symbolized
in their inexpressibly hideous flag. The element
is non-conductive, and receives no current from
progress, and it is therefore incommunicable to us
who are wrapped in the pride of evolution. The
question here and elsewhere is whether the Chinese
love money more or this inscrutable dragon element.
If it is money, their masks must have concealed a
satisfaction at the prospect of the increased trade
that follows our flag; if the dragon element, a
grim hope that we might be cut off in the wilderness
and annihilated by Asiatic hordes.</p>

<p>Unlike the Chinese, the Tomos are unaffectedly
glad to see us in the valley. The humblest peasant
is the richer by our presence, and the landowners
and traders are more prosperous than they have
been for many years. Their uncompromising reception
of us makes a withdrawal from the Chumbi
Valley impossible, for the Tibetans would punish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
them relentlessly for the assistance they have given
their enemies.</p>

<p>A mile beyond Gob-sorg is the Tibetan village of
Galing-ka, where the praying-flags are as thick as
masts in a dockyard, and streams of paper prayers
are hung across the valley to prevent the entrance
of evil spirits. Chubby little children run out and
salute one with a cry of 'Backsheesh!' the first
alien word in their infant vocabulary.</p>

<p>A mile further a sudden turn in the valley
brings one to a level plain&mdash;a phenomenally flat
piece of ground where one can race two miles along
the straight. No one passes it without remarking
that it is the best site for a hill-station in Northern
India. Where else can one find a racecourse, polo-ground,
fishing, and shooting, and a rainfall that
is little more than a third of that of Darjeeling?
Three hundred feet above the stream on the west
bank is a plateau, apparently intended for building
sites. The plain in the valley was naturally designed
for the training of mounted infantry, and is
now, probably for the first time, being turned to
its proper use.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Lingmathang</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>March 18</i>.</span></p>

<p>I have left the discomforts of Phari, and am
camping now on the Lingmathang Plain. I am
writing in a natural cave in the rock. The opening
is walled in by a sangar of stones 5 feet high,
from which pine-branches support a projecting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
roof. On fine days the space between the roof
and wall is left open, and called the window; but
when it snows, gunny-bags are let down as purdahs,
and the den becomes very warm and comfortable.
There is a natural hearth, a natural chimney-piece,
and a natural chimney that draws excellently. The
place is sheltered by high cliffs, and it is very
pleasant to look out from this snugness on a wintry
landscape, and ground covered deep with snow.</p>

<p>Outside, seventy shaggy Tibetan ponies, rough
and unshod, averaging 12¬∑2 hands, are tethered
under the shelter of a rocky cliff. They are being
trained according to the most approved methods of
modern warfare. The Mounted Infantry Corps,
mostly volunteers from the 23rd and 32nd Pioneers
and 8th Gurkhas, are under the command of
Captain Ottley of the 23rd. The corps was raised
at Gnatong in December, and though many of
the men had not ridden before, after two months'
training they cut a very respectable figure in the
saddle. A few years ago a proposal was made to
the military authorities that the Pioneers, like other
regiments, should go in for a course of mounted
infantry training. The reply caused much amusement
at the time. The suggestion was not adopted,
but orders were issued that 'every available opportunity
should be taken of teaching the Pioneers to
ride in carts.' A wag in the force naturally suggests
that the new Ekka Corps, now running
between Phari and Tuna, should be utilized to
carry out the spirit of this order. Certainly on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
road beyond the Tangla the ekkas would require
some sitting.</p>

<p>The present mission is the third 'show' on which
the 23rd and 32nd have been together during the
last nine years. In Chitral and Waziristan they
fought side by side. It is no exaggeration to say
that these regiments have been on active service
three years out of five since they were raised in
1857. The original draft of the 32nd, it will be
remembered, was the unarmed volunteer corps of
Mazbi Sikhs, who offered themselves as an escort
to the convoy from Lahore to Delhi during the
siege. The Mazbis were the most lawless and
refractory folk in the Punjab, and had long been
the despair of Government. On arrival at Delhi
they were employed in the trenches, rushing in to
fill up the places of the killed and wounded as fast
as they fell. It will be remembered that they
formed the fatigue party who carried the powder-bags
to blow up the Cashmere Gate. A hundred
and fifty-seven of them were killed during the
siege. With this brilliant opening it is no wonder
that they have been on active service almost continually
since.</p>

<p>A frontier campaign would be incomplete without
the 32nd or 23rd. It was the 32nd who
cut their way through 5 feet of snow, and
carried the battery guns to the relief of Chitral.
The 23rd Pioneers were also raised from the Mazbi
Sikhs in the same year of the Mutiny, 1857. The
history of the two regiments is very similar. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
23rd distinguished themselves in China, Abyssinia,
Afghanistan, and numerous frontier campaigns.
One of the most brilliant exploits was when, with
the Gordon Highlanders under Major (now Sir
George) White, they captured the Afghan guns at
Kandahar. To-day the men of the two regiments
meet again as members of the same corps on the
Lingmathang Plain. Naturally the most cordial
relations exist between the men, and one can hear
them discussing old campaigns as they sit round
their pinewood fires in the evenings. They and
the twenty men of the 8th Gurkhas (of Manipur
fame) turn out together every morning for exercise
on their diminutive steeds. They ride without
saddle or stirrups, and though they have only been
horsemen for two months, they seldom fall off at
the jumps. The other day, when a Mazbi Sikh
took a voluntary into the hedge, a genial Gurkha
reminded him of the eccentric order 'to practise
riding in carts.'</p>

<p>At Lingmathang we have had a fair amount of
sport of a desultory kind. The neighbouring forests
are the home of that very rare and little-known
animal, the shao, or Sikkim stag. The first animal
of the species to fall to a European gun was shot
by Major Wallace Dunlop on the Lingmathang
Hills in January. A month later Captain Ottley
wounded a buck which he was not able to follow
up on account of a heavy fall of snow. Lately one
or two shao&mdash;does in all cases&mdash;have come down to
visit the plain. While we were breakfasting on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
morning of the 16th, we heard a great deal of
shouting and halloaing, and a Gurkha jemadar ran
up to tell us that a female shao, pursued by village
dogs, had broken through the jungle on the hillside
and emerged on the plain a hundred yards
from our camp. We mounted at once, and Ottley
deployed the mounted infantry, who were ready
for parade, to head the beast from the hills. The
shao jinked like a hare, and crossed and recrossed
the stream several times, but the poor beast was
exhausted, and, after twenty minutes' exciting
chase, we surrounded it. Captain Ottley threw
himself on the animal's neck and held it down
until a sepoy arrived with ropes to bind its hind-legs.
The chase was certainly a unique incident in
the history of sport&mdash;a field of seventy in the
Himalayas, a clear spurt in the open, no dogs, and
the quarry the rarest zoological specimen in the
world. The beast stood nearly 14 hands, and was
remarkable for its long ears and elongated jaw.
The sequel was sad. Besides the fright and
exhaustion, the captured shao sustained an injury
in the loin; it pined, barely nibbled at its food,
and, after ten days, died.</p>

<p>Sikkim stags are sometimes shot by native
shikaris, and there is great rivalry among members
of the mission force in buying their heads. They
are shy, inaccessible beasts, and they are not met
with beyond the wood limit.</p>

<p>The shooting in the Chumbi Valley is interesting
to anyone fond of natural history, though it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
little disappointing from the sportsman's point of
view. When officers go out for a day's shooting,
they think they have done well if they bring home
a brace of pheasants. When the sappers and miners
began to work on the road below Gautsa, the blood-pheasants
used to come down to the stream to watch
the operations, but now one sees very few game-birds
in the valley. The minal is occasionally shot.
The cock-bird, as all sportsmen know, is, with the
exception of the Argus-eye, the most beautiful
pheasant in the world. There is a lamasery in
the neighbourhood, where the birds are almost
tame. The monks who feed them think that they
are inhabited by the spirits of the blest. Where
the snow melts in the pine-forests and leaves soft
patches and moist earth, you will find the blood-pheasant.
When you disturb them they will run
up the hillside and call vociferously from their
new hiding-place, so that you may get another
shot. Pheasant-shooting here is not sport; the
birds seldom rise, and when they do it is almost
impossible to get a shot at them in the thick
jungle. One must shoot them running for the
pot. Ten or a dozen is not a bad bag for one
gun later in the year, when more snow has fallen.</p>

<p>At a distance the blood-pheasant appears a dowdy
bird. The hen is quite insignificant, but, on a closer
acquaintance, the cock shows a delicate colour-scheme
of mauve, pink, and green, which is quite
different from the plumage of any other bird I
have seen. The skins fetch a good price at home,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
as fishermen find them useful for making flies. A
sportsman who has shot in the Yatung Valley
regularly for four years tells me that the cock-bird
of this species is very much more numerous than
the hen. Another Chumbi pheasant is the tracopan,
a smaller bird than the minal, and very beautifully
marked. I have not heard of a tracopan being shot
this season; the bird is not at all common anywhere
on this side of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>Snow-partridge sometimes come down to the
Lingmathang hills; in the adjacent Kongbu Valley
they are plentiful. These birds are gregarious, and
are found among the large, loose boulders on the
hill-tops. In appearance they are a cross between
the British grouse and the red-legged partridge,
having red feet and legs uncovered with feathers,
and a red bill and chocolate breast. The feathers
of the back and rump are white, with broad,
defined bars of rich black.</p>

<p>Another common bird is the snow-pigeon. Large
flocks of them may be seen circling about the
valley anywhere between Phari and Chumbi.
Sometimes, when we are sitting in our cave after
dinner, we hear the tweek of solitary snipe flying
overhead, but we have never flushed any. Every
morning before breakfast I stroll along the river
bank with a gun, and often put up a stray duck.
I have frequently seen goosanders on the river,
but not more than two or three in a party. They
never leave the Himalayas. The only migratory
duck I have observed are the common teal and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Brahminy or ruddy sheldrake, and these only in
pairs. The latter, though despised on the plains,
are quite edible up here. I discredit the statement
that they feed on carrion, as I have never seen one
near the carcasses of the dead transport animals
that are only too plentiful in the valley just now.
After comparing notes with other sportsmen, I
conclude that the Ammo Chu Valley is not a
regular route for migratory duck. The odd teal
that I shot in February were probably loiterers
that were not strong enough to join in the flight
southwards.</p>

<p>Near Lingmathang I shot the ibis bill (<i>Ibidorhynchus
Struthersi</i>), a bird which is allied to the
oyster catchers. This was the first Central Asian
species I met.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Gautsa</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>February</i>.</span></p>

<p>Gautsa, which lies five miles north of Lingmathang,
nearly half-way between Chumbi and
Phari, must be added to the map. A week or two
ago the place was deserted and unnamed; it did
not boast a single cowherd's hut. Now it is a busy
camp, and likely to be a permanent halting-place
on the road to Phari. The camp lies in a deep,
moss-carpeted hollow, with no apparent egress.
On three sides it is flanked by rocky cliffs, densely
forested with pine and silver birch; on the fourth
rises an abrupt wall of rock, which is suffused with
a glow of amber light an hour before sunset. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Ammo Chu, which is here nothing but a 20-foot
stream frozen over at night, bisects the camp.
The valley is warm and sheltered, and escapes
much of the bitter wind that never spares Chumbi.
After dinner one prefers the open-air and a camp
fire. Officers who have been up the line before
turn into their tents regretfully, for they know that
they are saying good-bye to comfort, and will not
enjoy the genial warmth of a good fire again until
they have crossed the bleak Tibetan tablelands and
reached the sparsely-wooded Valley of Gyantse.</p>

<small>PHARI JONG</small></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="r2"><i>February</i> 15.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icy</span> winds and suffocating smoke are not conducive
to a literary style, though they sometimes
inspire a rude eloquence that is quite unfit for
publication. As I write we are huddling over the
mess-room brazier&mdash;our youngest optimist would
not call it a fire. Men drop in now and then from
fatigue duty, and utter an incisive phrase that
expresses the general feeling, while we who write
for an enlightened public must sacrifice force for
euphemism. A week at Phari dispels all illusions;
only a bargee could adequately describe the place.
Yet the elements, which 'feelingly persuade us'
what we are, sometimes inspire us with the
eloquence of discomfort.</p>

<p>At Gautsa the air was scented with the fragrance
of warm pine-trees, and there was no indication of
winter save the ice on the Ammo Chu. The
torrent roared boisterously beneath its frozen surface,
and threw up little tentacles of frozen spray,
which glistened fantastically in the sun. Three
miles further up the stream the wood-belt ends
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
abruptly; then, after another three miles, one
passes the last stunted bush; after that there is
nothing but brown earth and yellow withered
grass.</p>

<p>Five miles above Gautsa is Dotah, the most
cheerless camp on the march. The wind blows
through the gorge unceasingly, and penetrates to
the bone. On the left bank of the stream is the
frozen waterfall, which might be worshipped by
the fanciful and superstitious as embodying the
genius of the place, hard and resistless, a crystallized
monument of the implacable spirit of Nature
in these high places.</p>

<p>At Kamparab, where we camped, two miles higher
up the stream, the thermometer fell to 14¬∞ below
zero. Close by is the meeting-place of the sources
of the Ammo Chu. All the plain is undermined
with the warrens of the long-haired marmots and
voles, who sit on their thresholds like a thousand
little spies, and curiously watch our approach, then
dive down into their burrows to tell their wives of
the strange bearded invaders. They are the despair
of their rivals, the sappers and miners, who are
trying to make a level road for the new light
ekkas. One envies them their warmth and snugness
as one rides against the bitter penetrating
winds.</p>

<p>Twelve miles from Gautsa a turn in the valley
brings one into view of Phari Jong. At first sight
it might be a huge isolated rock, but as one
approaches the bastions and battlements become
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
more distinct. Distances are deceptive in this
rarefied air, and objects that one imagines to be
quite close are sometimes found to be several miles
distant.</p>

<p>The fort is built on a natural mound in the
plain. It is a huge rambling building six stories
high, surrounded by a courtyard, where mules and
ponies are stabled. As a military fortification
Phari Jong is by no means contemptible. The
walls are of massive stonework which would take
heavy guns to demolish. The angles are protected
from attacking parties by machicolated galleries, and
three enormous bastions project from each flank.
These are crumbling in places, and the Pioneers
might destroy the bastion and breach the wall with
a bag or two of guncotton. On the eastern side
there is a square courtyard like an Arab caravanserai,
where cattle are penned. The fortress would
hold the whole Tibetan army, with provisions for a
year. It was evacuated the night before we reconnoitred
the valley.</p>

<p>The interior of the Jong is a warren of stairs,
landings, and dark cavernous rooms, which would
take a whole day to explore. The walls are built
of stone and mud, and coated with century-old
smoke. There are no chimneys or adequate
windows, and the filth is indescribable. When
Phari was first occupied, eighty coolies were
employed a whole week clearing away refuse.
Judging by the accretion of dirt, a new-comer
might class the building as medieval; but filth is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
no criterion of age, for everything left in the same
place becomes quickly coated with grime an inch
thick. The dust that invades one's tent at Chumbi
is clean and wholesome compared to the Phari dirt,
which is the filth of human habitation, the secretion
of centuries of foul living. It falls from the roof on
one's head, sticks to one's clothes as one brushes
against the wall, and is blown up into one's eyes
and throat from the floor.</p>

<p>The fort is most insanitary, but a military occupation
is necessary. The hacking coughs which
are prevalent among officers and men are due to
impurities of the air which affect the lungs. Cartloads
of dirt are being scraped away every day, but
gusts of wind from the lower stories blow up more
dust, which penetrates every nook and cranny of
the draughty rooms, so that there is a fresh layer
by nightfall. To clear the lower stories and cellars
would be a hopeless task; even now rooms are
found in unexpected places which emit clouds of
dust whenever the wind eddies round the basement.</p>

<p>I explored the ground-floor with a lantern, and
was completely lost in the maze of passages and
dark chambers. When we first occupied the fort,
they were filled with straw, gunpowder, and old
arms. A hundred and forty maunds of inferior
gunpowder was destroyed, and the arms now litter
the courtyard. These the Tibetans themselves
abandoned as rubbish. The rusty helmets, shields,
and breastplates are made of the thinnest iron
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
plates interlaced with leathern thongs, and would
not stop an arrow. The old bell-mouthed matchlocks,
with their wooden ground-rests, would be
more dangerous to the Tibetan marksmen than the
enemy. The slings and bows and arrows are
reckoned obsolete even by these primitive warriors.
Perhaps they attribute more efficacy to the praying-wheels
which one encounters at every corner
of the fort. The largest are in niches in the wall
to left and right of the gateway; rows of smaller
ones are attached to the banisters on the landings
and to the battlements of the roof. The wheels are
covered with grime&mdash;the grime of Lamas' hands.
Dirt and religion are inseparable in Tibet. The
Lamas themselves are the most filthy and malodorous
folk I have met in the country. From
this it must not be inferred that one class is more
cleanly in its habits than another, for nobody ever
thinks of washing. Soap is not included in the list
of sundries that pass the Customs House at
Yatung. If the Lamas are dirtier than the yak-herds
and itinerant merchants it is because they
lead an indoor life, whereas the pastoral folk are
continually exposed to the purifying winds of the
tablelands, which are the nearest equivalent in
Tibet to a cold bath.</p>

<p>I once read of a Tibetan saint, one of the pupils
of Naropa, who was credited with a hundred
miraculous gifts, one of which was that he could
dive into the water like a fish. Wherein the
miracle lay had often puzzled me, but when I met
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the Lamas of the Kanjut Gompa I understood at
once that it was the holy man's contact with the water.</p>

<p>Phari is eloquent of piety, as it is understood in
Tibet. The better rooms are frescoed with
Buddhistic paintings, and on the third floor is a
library, now used as a hospital, where xylograph
editions of the Lamaist scriptures and lives of the
saints are pigeon-holed in lockers in the wall. The
books are printed on thin oblong sheets of Chinese
paper, enclosed in boards, and illuminated with
quaint coloured tailpieces of holy men in devotional
attitudes. Phari fort, with its casual blending
of East and West, is full of incongruous effects,
but the oddest and most pathetic incongruity is the
chorten on the roof, from which, amidst praying-flags
and pious offerings of coloured raiment,
flutters the Union Jack.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r2"><i>February</i> 18.</span></p>

<p>The troops are so busy making roads that they
have very little time for amusements. The
8th Gurkhas have already constructed some eight
miles of road on each side of Phari for the ekka
transport. Companies of the 23rd Pioneers are
repairing the road at Dotah, Chumbi, and Rinchengong.
The 32nd are working at Rinchengong,
and the sappers and miners on the Nathula and
at Gautsa.</p>

<p>We have started football, and the Gurkhas have
a very good idea of the game. One loses one's
wind completely at this elevation after every spurt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of twenty yards, but recovers it again in a wonderfully
short time. Other amusements are sliding
and tobogganing, which are a little disappointing
to enthusiasts. The ice is lumpy and broken, and
the streamlets that run down to the plain are so tortuous
that fifty yards without a spill is considered
a good run for a toboggan. The funniest sight is to
see the Gurkha soldiers trying to drag the toboggan
uphill, slipping and tumbling and sprawling on the
ice, and immensely enjoying one another's discomfiture.</p>

<p>To clear the dust from one's throat and shake
off the depression caused by weeks of waiting in
the same place, there is nothing like a day's shooting
or exploring in the neighbourhood of Phari.
I get up sometimes before daybreak, and spend the
whole day reconnoitring with a small party of
mounted infantry. Yesterday we crossed a pass
which looked down into the Kongbu Valley&mdash;a
likely camping-ground for the Tibetan troops.
The valley is connected to the north with the
Tuna plateau, and is almost as fertile in its lower
stretches as Chumbi. A gray fortress hangs over
the cliff on the western side of the valley, and
above it tower the glaciers of Shudu-Tsenpa and
the Gora Pass into Sikkim. On the eastern side,
at a creditable distance from the fort, we could
see the Kongbu nunnery, which looked from where
we stood like an old Roman viaduct. The nuns,
I was told, are rarely celibate; they shave the
head and wear no ornaments.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Riding back we saw some burrhel on the opposite
hills, too far off to make a successful stalk possible.
The valley is full of them, and a week later some
officers from Phari on a yak-collecting expedition
got several good heads. The Tibetan gazelle,
or goa (<i>Gazella hirticaudata</i>), is very common
on the Phari plateau, and we bagged two that afternoon.
When the force first occupied the Jong,
they were so tame that a sportsman could walk up
to within 100 yards of a herd, and it was not
an uncommon thing for three buck to fall to the
same gun in a morning. Now one has to man&oelig;uvre
a great deal to get within 300 yards of them.</p>

<p>Sportsmen who have travelled in other parts of
Tibet say the goa are very shy and inaccessible.
Perhaps their comparative tameness near Phari
may be accounted for by the fact that the old trade
route crosses the plateau, and they have never been
molested by the itinerant merchants and carriers.
Gazelle meat is excellent. It has been a great
resource for the garrison. No epicure could wish
for anything better.</p>

<p>Another unfamiliar beast that one meets in the
neighbourhood of Phari is the kyang, or Tibetan
wild ass (<i>Equus hemionus</i>), one or two of which
have been shot for specimens. The kyang is more
like a zebra than a horse or donkey. Its flesh, I
believe, is scorned even by camp-followers. Hare
are fairly plentiful, but they are quite flavourless.
A huge solitary gray wolf (<i>Canis laniger</i>) was shot
the other day, the only one of its kind I have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
seen. Occasionally one puts up a fox. The Tibetan
species has a very fine brush that fetches a fancy
price in the bazaar. At present there is too much
ice on the plain to hunt them, but they ought to
give good sport in the spring.</p>

<p>It was dark when we rode into the Jong. After
a long day in the saddle, dinner is good, even
though it is of yak's flesh, and it is good to sit in
front of a fire even though the smoke chokes you.
I went so far as to pity the cave-dwellers at Chumbi.
Phari is certainly very much colder, but it has its
diversions and interests. There is still some shooting
to be had, and the place has a quaint old-world
individuality of its own, which seasons the monotony
of life to a contemplative man. One is on the
borderland, and one has a Micawber-like feeling that
something may turn up. After dinner there is
bridge, which fleets the time considerably, but at
Chumbi there were no diversions of any kind&mdash;nothing
but dull, blank, uninterrupted monotony.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r2"><i>February</i> 20.</span></p>

<p>For two days half a blizzard has been blowing,
and expeditions have been impossible. Everything
one eats and drinks has the same taste of argol
smoke. At breakfast this morning we had to put
our <i>chapatties</i> in our pockets to keep them clean,
and kept our meat covered with a soup-plate,
making surreptitious dives at it with a fork. After
a few seconds' exposure it was covered with grime.
Sausages and bully beef, which had just been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
boiled, were found to be frozen inside. The smoke
in the mess-room was suffocating. So to bed,
wrapped in sheepskins and a sleeping-bag. Under
these depressing conditions I have been reading
the narratives of Bogle and Manning, old English
worthies who have left on record the most vivid
impressions of the dirt and cold and misery of
Phari.</p>

<p>It is ninety years since Thomas Manning passed
through Phari on his way to Lhasa. Previously
to his visit we only know of two Englishmen who
have set foot in Phari&mdash;Bogle in 1774, and Turner
in 1783, both emissaries of Warren Hastings.
Manning's journal is mostly taken up with complaints
of his Chinese servant, who seems to have
gained some mysterious ascendancy over him, and
to have exercised it most unhandsomely. As a
traveller Manning had a genius for missing effects;
it is characteristic of him that he spent sixteen days
at Phari, yet except for a casual footnote, evidently
inserted in his journal after his return, he makes no
mention of the Jong. Were it not for Bogle's
account of thirty years before, we might conclude
that the building was not then in existence.</p>

<p>On October 21, 1811, Manning writes in his
diary: 'We arrived at Phari Jong. Frost. Frost
also two days before. I was lodged in a strange
place, but so were the natives.' On the 27th
he summarized his impressions of Phari:&mdash;'Dirt,
dirt, grease, smoke, misery, but good mutton.'</p>

<p>Manning's journal is expressive, if monosyllabic.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
He was of the class of subjective travellers, who
visit the ends of the earth to record their own
personal discomforts. Sensitive, neurotic, ever on
the look-out for slights, he could not have been a
happy vagabond. A dozen lines record the impressions
of his first week at Phari. He was cheated;
he was treated civilly; he slighted the magistrates,
mistaking them for idle fellows; he was turned out
of his room to make way for Chinese soldiers; he
quarrelled with his servant. A single extract
portrays the man to the life, as if he were sitting
dejectedly by his yak-dung fire at this hour brooding
over his wrongs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Chinaman was cross again." Says I,
"Was that a bird at the magistrate's that flapped
so loud?" Answer: "What signifies whether it
was a bird or not?" Where he sat I thought he
might see; and I was curious to know if such large
birds frequented the <i>building</i>. These are the
answers I get. He is always discontented and
grumbling, and takes no trouble off my hands.
Being younger, and, like all Asiatics, able to stoop
and crouch without pain or difficulty, he might
assist me in many things without trouble to himself.
A younger brother or any English young
gentleman would in his place of course lay the
cloth, and do other little services when I am tired;
but he does not seem to have much of the generous
about him, nor does he in any way serve me, or
behave to me with any show of affection or goodwill:
consequently I grow no more attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
him than the first day I saw him. I could not have
thought it possible for me to have lived so long
with anyone without either disliking him or caring
sixpence for him. He has good qualities, too. The
strangeness of his situation may partly excuse him.
(I am more attached to my guide, with all his
faults, who has been with me but a few days.)
My guide has behaved so damnably ill since I
wrote that, that I wish it had not come into my
mind.'</p>

<p>I give the extract at length, not only as an
illuminating portrait of Manning, but as an incidental
proof that he visited the Jong, and that it was
very much the same building then as it is to-day.
But had it not been for the flapping of the bird
which occasioned the quarrel with his Chinese
servant, Manning would have left Phari without a
reference to the wonderful old fortress which is the
most romantic feature on the road from India to
Gyantse. Appended to the journal is this footnote
to the word <i>building</i>, which I have italicized in the
extract: 'The building is immensely large, six or
more stories high, a sort of fortress. At a distance
it appears to be all Phari Jong. Indeed, most of
it consists of miserable galleries and holes.'</p>

<p>Members of the mission force who have visited
Phari will no doubt attribute Manning's evident
ill-humour and depression during his stay there to
the environments of the place, which have not
changed much in the last ninety years. But his
spirits improved as he continued his journey to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Gyantse and Lhasa, and he reveals himself the
kindly, eccentric, and affectionate soul who was the
friend and intimate of Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>Bogle arrived at Phari on October 23, 1774. He
and Turner and Manning all entered Tibet through
Bhutan. 'As we advanced,' he wrote in his
journal, 'we came in sight of the castle of Phari
Jong, which cuts a good figure from without.
It rises into several towers with the balconies, and,
having few windows, has the look of strength; it is
surrounded by the town.' The only other reference
he makes to the Jong shows us that the fortress
was in bad repair so long ago as 1774. 'The two
Lhasa officers who have the government of Phari
Jong sent me some butter, tea, etc., the day after
my arrival; and letting me know that they expected
a visit from me, I went. The inside of the castle
did not answer the notion I had formed of it. The
stairs are ladders worn to the bone, and the rooms
are little better than garrets.'</p>

<p>The origin of the fort is unknown. Some of the
inhabitants of Phari say that it was built more than
a hundred years ago, when the Nepalese were overrunning
Sikkim. But this is obviously incorrect,
as the Tibetan-Nepalese War, in which the Chinese
drove the Gurkhas out of Tibet, and defeated their
army within a day's march of Khatmandu, took
place in 1788-1792, whereas Bogle's description of
the Jong was written fourteen years earlier. A
more general impression is that centuries ago orders
came from Lhasa to collect stones on the hillsides,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and the building was constructed by forced labour
in a few months. That is a tale of endurance and
suffering that might very likely be passed from
father to son for generations.</p>

<p>Bogle's description of the town might have been
written by an officer of the garrison to-day, only
he wrote from the inmate's point of view. He
noticed the houses 'so huddled together that one
may chance to overlook them,' and the flat roofs
covered with bundles of straw. He knocked his
head against the low ceilings, and ran against the
pillars that supported the beams. 'In the middle
of the roof,' he wrote, 'is a hole to let out smoke,
which, however, departs not without making the
whole room as black as a chimney. The opening
serves also to let in the light; the doors are full of
holes and crevices, through which the women and
children keep peeping.' Needless to say nothing
has changed in the last hundred and thirty years,
unless it is that the women are bolder. I looked
down from the roof this morning on Phari town,
lying like a rabbit-warren beneath the fort. All
one can see from the battlement are the flat roofs
of low black houses, from which smoke issues in
dense fumes. The roofs are stacked with straw,
and connected by a web of coloured praying-flags
running from house to house, and sometimes over
the narrow alleys that serve as streets. Enormous fat
ravens perch on the wall, and innumerable flocks
of twittering sparrows. For warmth's sake most
of the rooms are underground, and in these subterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
dens Tibetans, black as coal-heavers,
huddle together with yaks and mules. Tibetan
women, equally dirty, go about, their faces smeared
and blotched with caoutchouc, wearing a red, hoop-like
head-dress, ornamented with alternate turquoises
and ruby-coloured stones.</p>

</div>

<p>In the fort the first thing one meets of a morning
is a troop of these grimy sirens, climbing the stairs,
burdened with buckets of chopped ice and sacks of
yak-dung, the two necessaries of life. The Tibetan
coolie women are merry folk; they laugh and
chatter over their work all day long, and do not in
the least resist the familiarities of the Gurkha
soldiers. Sometimes as they pass one they giggle
coyly, and put out the tongue, which is their way
of showing respect to those in high places; but
when one hears their laughter echoing down the
stairs it is difficult to believe that it is not intended
for saucy impudence. Their merriment sounds
unnatural in all this filth and cold and discomfort.
Certainly if Bogle returned to Phari he would find
the women very much bolder, though, I am afraid,
not any cleaner. Could he see the Englishmen in
Phari to-day, he might not recognise his compatriots.</p>

<p>Often in civilized places I shall think of the
group at Phari in the mess-room after dinner&mdash;a
group of ruffianly-looking bandits in a blackened,
smut-begrimed room, clad in wool and fur from
head to foot, bearded like wild men of the woods,
and sitting round a yak-dung fire, drinking rum.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
After a week at Phari the best-groomed man might
qualify for a caricature of Bill Sikes. Perhaps one
day in Piccadilly one may encounter a half-remembered
face, and something familiar in walk or gait
may reveal an old friend of the Jong. Then in
'Jimmy's,' memories of argol-smoke and frozen
moustaches will give a zest to a bottle of beaune
or chablis, which one had almost forgotten was
once dreamed of among the unattainable luxuries
of life.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r2"><i>March 26-28.</i></span></p>

<p>Orders have come to advance from Phari Jong.
It seems impossible, unnatural, that we are going
on. After a week or two the place becomes part
of one's existence; one feels incarcerated there.
It is difficult to imagine life anywhere else. One
feels as if one could never again be cold or dirty,
or miserably uncomfortable, without thinking of
that gray fortress with its strange unknown
history, standing alone in the desolate plain. For
my own part, speaking figuratively&mdash;and unfigurative
language is impotent on an occasion like this&mdash;the
place will leave an indelible black streak&mdash;very
black indeed&mdash;on a kaleidoscopic past. There
can be no faint impressions in one's memories of
Phari Jong. The dirt and smoke and dust are
elemental, and the cold is the cold of the Lamas'
frigid hell.</p>

<p>All the while I was in Phari I forgot the
mystery of Tibet. I have felt it elsewhere, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in the Jong I only wondered that the inscrutable
folk who had lived in the rooms where we slept,
and fled in the night, were content with their
smut-begrimed walls, blackened ceilings, and
chimneyless roofs, and still more how amidst these
murky environments any spiritual instincts could
survive to inspire the religious frescoings on the
wall. Yet every figure in this intricate blending of
designs is significant and symbolical. One's first
impression is that these allegories and metaphysical
abstractions must have been meaningless to the
inmates of the Jong; for we in Europe cannot
dissociate the artistic expression of religious feeling
from cleanliness and refinement, or at least pious
care. One feels that they must be the relics of a
decayed spirituality, preserved not insincerely, but
in ignorant superstition, like other fetishes all over
the world. Yet this feeling of scepticism is not
so strong after a month or two in Tibet. At first
one is apt to think of these dirty people as merely
animal and sensual, and to attribute their religious
observances to the fear of demons who will
punish the most trivial omission in ritual.</p>

<p>Next one begins to wonder if they really believe
in the efficacy of mechanical prayer, if they take
the trouble to square their conscience with their
inclinations, and if they have any sincere desire to
be absorbed in the universal spirit. Then there
may come a suspicion that the better classes,
though not given to inquiry, have a settled dogma
and definite convictions about things spiritual and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
natural that are not easily upset. Perhaps before
we turn our backs on the mystery of Tibet we
will realize that the Lamas despise us as gross
materialists and philistines&mdash;we who are always
groping and grasping after the particular, while
they are absorbed in the sublime and universal.</p>

<p>After all, devious and unscrupulous as their
policy may have been, the Tibetans have had one
definite aim in view for centuries&mdash;the preservation
of their Church and State by the exclusion of all
foreign and heretical influences. When we know
that the Mongol cannot conceive of the separation
of the spiritual and temporal Government, it is
only natural to infer that the first mission, spiritual
or otherwise, to a foreign Court should introduce
the first elements of dissolution in a system of
Government that has held the country intact for
centuries. And let it be remarked that Great
Britain is not responsible for this deviation in a
hitherto inveterate policy.</p>

<p>But to return to Phari. My last impression of
the place as I passed out of its narrow alleys was
a very dirty old man, seated on a heap of yak-dung
over the gutter. He was turning his prayer-wheel,
and muttering the sacred formula that was
to release him from all rebirth in this suffering
world. The wish seemed natural enough.</p>

<p>It was a bright, clear morning when we turned
our backs on the old fort and started once more
on the road to Lhasa. Five miles from Phari we
passed the miserable little village of Chuggya,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
which is apparently inhabited by ravens and sparrows,
and a diminutive mountain-finch that looks
like a half-starved robin. A mile to the right
before entering the village is the monastery of
the Red Lamas, which was the lodging-place
of the Bhutanese Envoy during his stay at
Phari. The building, which is a landmark for
miles, is stone-built, and coated over with red
earth, which gives it the appearance of brick. Its
overhanging gables, mullioned windows without
glass, that look like dominoes in the distance, the
pendent bells, and the gay decorations of Chinese
paper, look quaint and mystical, and are in keeping
with the sacred character of the place. Bogle
stopped here on October 27, 1774, and drank tea
with the Abbot. It is very improbable that any
other white man has set foot in the monastery
since, until the other day, when some of the
garrison paid it a visit and took photographs of
the interior. The Lamas were a little deprecatory,
but evidently amused. I did not expect them to
be so tolerant of intrusion, and their clamour for
backsheesh on our departure dispelled one more
illusion.</p>

<p>At Chuggya we were at the very foot of Chumulari
(23,930 feet), which seems to rise sheer from
the plain. The western flank is an abrupt wall of
rock, but, as far as one can see, the eastern side is
a gradual ascent of snow, which would present no
difficulties to the trained mountaineer. One could
ride up to 17,000 feet, and start the climb from a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
base 2,000 feet higher than Mont Blanc. Chumulari
is the most sacred mountain in Tibet, and it is
usual for devout Buddhists to stop and offer a
sacrifice as they pass. Bogle gives a detailed
account of the service, the rites of which are very
similar to some I witnessed at Galingka on the
Tibetan New Year, February 16.</p>

<p>'Here we halted,' he wrote in his journal, 'and
the servants gathering together a parcel of dried
cow-dung, one of them struck fire with his tinder-box
and lighted it. When the fire was well
kindled, Parma took out a book of prayers, one
brought a copper cup, another filled it with a kind
of fermented liquor out of a new-killed sheep's
paunch, mixing in some rice and flour; and after
throwing some dried herbs and flour into the flame,
they began their rites. Parma acted as chaplain.
He chanted the prayers in a loud voice, the others
accompanying him, and every now and then the
little cup was emptied towards the rock, about
eight or ten of these libations being poured forth.
The ceremony was finished by placing upon the
heap of stones the little ensign which my fond
imagination had before offered up to my own
vanity.'</p>

<p>Most of the flags and banners one sees to-day on
the chortens and roofs of houses, and cairns on the
mountain-tops, must be planted with some such
inaugural ceremony.</p>

<p>Facing Chumulari on the west, and apparently
only a few miles distant, are the two Sikkim peaks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Powhunri (23,210 feet) and Shudu-Tsenpa
(22,960 feet). From Chuggya the Tangla is
reached by a succession of gradual rises and depressions.
The pass is not impressive, like the
Jelap, as a passage won through a great natural
barrier. One might cross it without noticing the
summit, were it not for the customary cairns and
praying-flags which the Lamas raise in all high
places.</p>

<p>From a slight rise on the east of the pass one
can look down across the plateau on Tuna, an
irregular black line like a caterpillar, dotted with
white spots, which glasses reveal to be tents. The
Bamtso lake lies shimmering to the east beneath
brown and yellow hills. At noon objects dance
elusively in the mirage. Distances are deceptive.
Yaks grazing are like black Bedouin tents. Here,
then, is the forbidden land. The approach is as it
should be. One's eyes explore the road to Lhasa
dimly through a haze. One would not have it
laid out with the precision of a diagram.</p>

<small>THE ROAD AND TRANSPORT</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> write of any completed phase of the expedition
at this stage, when I have carried my readers
only as far as Tuna, is a lapse in continuity that
requires an apology. My excuse is that to all
transport officers, and everyone who was in touch
with them, the Tuna and Phari plains will be
remembered as the very backbone of resistance,
the most implacable barriers to our advance.</p>

<p>The expedition was essentially a transport
'show.' It is true that the Tibetans proved
themselves brave enemies, but their acquired
military resources are insignificant when compared
with the obstacles Nature has planted in
the path of their enemies. The difficulty of the
passes, the severity of the climate, the sterility
of the mountains and tablelands, make the interior
of the country almost inaccessible to an
invading army. That we went through these
obstacles and reached Lhasa itself was a matter
of surprise not only to the Tibetans, but to
many members of the expeditionary force.</p>

<p>To appreciate the difficulties the mission force
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
had to contend with, one must first realize the
extraordinary changes of climate that are experienced
in the journey from Siliguri to Tuna.
Choose the coldest day in the year at Kew Gardens,
expose yourself freely to the wind, and then spend
five minutes in the tropical house, and you may
gather some idea of the sensation of sleeping in
the Rungpo Valley the night after crossing the
Jelapla.</p>

<p>When I first made the journey in early January,
even the Rungpo Valley was chilly, and the
vicissitudes were not so marked; but I felt the
change very keenly in March, when I made a
hurried rush into Darjeeling for equipment and
supplies. Our camp at Lingmathang was in the
pine-forest at an elevation of 10,500 feet. It was
warm and sunny in the daytime, in places where
there was shelter from the wind. Leaf-buds were
beginning to open, frozen waterfalls to thaw,
migratory duck were coming up the valley in
twos and threes from the plains of India&mdash;even a
few vultures had arrived to fatten on the carcasses
of the dead transport animals. The morning after
leaving Lingmathang I left the pine-forest at
13,000 feet, and entered a treeless waste of shale
and rock. When I crossed the Jelapla half a
hurricane was blowing. The path was a sheet
of ice, and I had to use hands and knees, and take
advantage of every protuberance in the rock to
prevent myself from being blown over the <i>khud</i>.
The road was impassable for mules and ponies.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
The cold was numbing. The next evening, in a
valley 13,000 feet beneath, I was suffering from
the extreme of heat. The change in scenery and
vegetation is equally striking&mdash;from glaciers and
moraines to tropical forests brilliant with the
scarlet cotton-flower and purple Baleria. In Tibet
I had not seen an insect of any kind for two
months, but in the Sikkim valleys the most
gorgeous butterflies were abundant, and the rest-house
at Rungpo was invested by a plague of
flies. In the hot weather the climate of the
Sikkim valleys is more trying than that of most
stations in the plains of India. The valleys are
close and shut in, and the heat is intensified by
the radiation from the rocks, cliffs, and boulders.
In the rains the climate is relaxing and malarious.
The Supply and Transport Corps, who were left
behind at stages like Rungpo through the hot
weather, had, to my mind, a much harder time
on the whole than the half-frozen troops at the
front, and they were left out of all the fun.</p>

<p>Besides the natural difficulties of the road, the
severity of climate, and the scarcity of fodder and
fuel, the Transport Corps had to contend with
every description of disease and misfortune&mdash;anthrax,
rinderpest, foot and mouth disease,
aconite and rhododendron poisoning, falling over
precipices, exhaustion from overwork and underfeeding.
The worst fatalities occurred on the
Khamba Jong side in 1903. The experiments
with the transport were singularly unsuccessful.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Out of two hundred buffaloes employed at low
elevations, only three survived, and the seven
camels that were tried on the road between Siliguri
and Gantok all died by way of protest.
Later on in the year the yak corps raised in Nepal
was practically exterminated. From four to five
thousand were originally purchased, of which
more than a thousand died from anthrax before
they reached the frontier. All the drinking-water
on the route was infected; the Nepalese
did not believe the disease was contagious, and
took no precautions. The disease spread almost
universally among the cattle, and at the worst
time twenty or thirty died a day. The beasts
were massed on the Nepal frontier. Segregation
camps were formed, and ultimately, after much
patient care, the disease was stamped out.</p>

<p>Then began the historic march through Sikkim,
which, as a protracted struggle against natural
calamities, might be compared to the retreat of
the Ten Thousand, or the flight of the Kalmuck
Tartars. Superstitious natives might well think
that a curse had fallen on us and our cattle.
As soon as they were immune from anthrax, the
reduced corps were attacked by rinderpest, which
carried off seventy. When the herds left the
Singli-la range and descended into the valley, the
sudden change in climate overwhelmed hundreds.
No real yak survived the heat of the Sikkim
valleys. All that were now left were the zooms, or
halfbreeds from the bull-yaks and the cow, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
cross from the bull and female yaks. In Sikkim,
which is always a hotbed of contagious cattle
diseases, the wretched survivors were infected
with foot and mouth disease. The epidemic is
not often fatal, but visiting an exhausted herd,
fever-stricken, and weakened by every vicissitude
of climate, it carried off scores. Then, to avoid
spreading contagion, the yaks were driven through
trackless, unfrequented country, up and down
precipitous mountain-sides, and through dense
forests. Again segregation camps were formed,
and the dead cattle were burnt, twenty and thirty
at a time. Every day there was a holocaust.
Then followed the ascent into high altitudes,
where a more insidious evil awaited the luckless
corps. The few survivors were exterminated by
pleuro-pneumonia. When, on January 23, the
3rd Yak Corps reached Chumbi, it numbered 437;
two months afterwards all but 70 had died. On
March 21, 80 exhausted beasts straggled into
Chumbi; they were the remainder of the 1st and
2nd Yak Corps, which originally numbered 2,300
heads. The officers, who, bearded and weather-beaten,
deserted by many of their followers, after
months of wandering, reached our camp with the
remnants of the corps, told a story of hardship
and endurance that would provide a theme for an
epic.</p>

<p>The epic of the yaks does not comprise the
whole tale of disaster. Rinderpest carried off
77 pack-bullocks out of 500, and a whole corps
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
was segregated for two months with foot and
mouth disease. Amongst other casualties there
were heavy losses among the Cashmere pony
corps, and the Tibet pony corps raised locally.
The animals were hastily mobilized and incompletely
equipped, overworked and underfed.
Cheap and inferior saddlery was issued, which
gave the animals sore backs within a week.
The transport officer was in a constant dilemma.
He had to overwork his animals or delay the
provisions, fodder, and warm clothing so urgently
needed at the front. Ponies and mules had no
rest, but worked till they dropped. Of the
original draft of mules that were employed
on the line to Khamba Jong, fully 50 per
cent. died. It is no good trying to blink the
fact that the expedition was unpopular, and
that at the start many economical shifts were
attempted which proved much more expensive
in the end. Our party system is to blame. The
Opposition must be appeased, expenses kept down,
and the business is entered into half-heartedly.
In the usual case a few companies are grudgingly
sent to the front, and then, when something like
a disaster falls or threatens, John Bull jumps at
the sting, scenting a national insult. A brigade
follows, and Government wakes to the necessity
of grappling with the situation seriously.</p>

<p>But to return to the spot where the evil effects
of the system were felt, and not merely girded at.
To replace and supplement the local drafts of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
animals that were dying, trained Government
mule corps were sent up from the plains, properly
equipped and under experienced officers. These
did excellent work, and 2,600 mules arrived in
Lhasa on August 3 in as good condition as one
could wish. Of all transport animals, the mule is
the hardiest and most enduring. He does not
complain when he is overloaded, but will go on
all day, and when he drops there is no doubt that
he has had enough. Nine times out of ten when
he gives up he dies. No beast is more indifferent
to extremes of heat and cold. On the road from
Kamparab to Phari one day, three mules fell over
a cliff into a snowdrift, and were almost totally
submerged. Their drivers could not pull them
out, and, to solve the dilemma, went on and reported
them dead. The next day an officer found
them and extricated them alive. They had been
exposed to 46¬∞ of frost. They still survive.</p>

<p>Nothing can beat the Sircar mule when he is in
good condition, unless it is the Balti and Ladaki
coolie. Several hundred of these hardy mountaineers
were imported from the North-West
frontier to work on the most dangerous and difficult
sections of the road. They can bear cold and
fatigue and exposure better than any transport
animal on the line, and they are surer-footed.
Mules were first employed over the Jelap, but were
afterwards abandoned for coolies. The Baltis are
excellent workers at high altitudes, and sing
cheerily as they toil up the mountains with their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
loads. I have seen them throw down their packs
when they reached the summit of a pass, make a
rush for the shelter of a rock, and cheer lustily
like school-boys. But the coolies were not all
equally satisfactory. Those indented from the
Nepal durbar were practically an impressed gang.
Twelve rupees a month with rations and warm
clothing did not seem to reconcile them to hard
work, and after a month or two they became discontented
and refractory. Their officers, however,
were men of tact and decision, and they
were able to prevent what might have been a
serious mutiny. The discontented ones were
gradually replaced by Baltis, Ladakis, and Garwhalis,
and the coolies became the most reliable
transport corps on the line.</p>

<p>Thus, the whole menagerie, to use the expression
current at the time, was got into working order,
and a system was gradually developed by which
the right animal, man, or conveyance was working
in the right place, and supplies were sent through
at a pace that was very creditable considering the
country traversed.</p>

<p>From the railway base at Siliguri to Gantok, a
distance of sixty miles, the ascent in the road is
scarcely perceptible. With the exception of a few
contractors' ponies, the entire carrying along this
section of the line was worked by bullock-carts.
Government carts are built to carry 11 maunds
(880 pounds), but contractors often load theirs
with 15 or 16 maunds. As the carrying power
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of mules, ponies, and pack-bullocks is only
2 maunds, it will be seen at once that transport
in a mountainous country, where there can be no
road for vehicles, is nearly five times as difficult
and complicated as in the plains. And this is
without making any allowance for the inevitable
mortality among transport animals at high elevations,
or taking into account the inevitable congestion
on mountain-paths, often blocked by
snow, carried away by the rains, and always too
narrow to admit of any large volume of traffic.</p>

<p>In the beginning of March, when the line was
in its best working order, from 1,500 to 2,000
maunds were poured into Rungpo daily. Of
these, only 400 or 500 maunds reached Phari; the
rest was stored at Gantok or consumed on the
road. Later, when the line was extended to
Gyantse, not more than 100 maunds a day reached
the front.</p>

<p>In the first advance on Gyantse, our column
was practically launched into the unknown. As
far as we knew, no local food or forage could be
obtained. It was too early in the season for the
spring pasturage. We could not live on the
country. The ever-lengthening line of communication
behind us was an artery, the severing of
which would be fatal to our advance.</p>

<p>One can best realize the difficulties grappled
with by imagining the extreme case of an army
entering an entirely desert country. A mule, it
must be remembered, can only carry its own food
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
for ten days. That is to say, in a country where
there is no grain or fodder, a convoy can make
at the most nine marches. On the ninth day
beasts and drivers will have consumed all the
supplies taken with them. Supposing on the
tenth day no supply-base has been reached, the
convoy is stranded, and can neither advance nor
retire. Nor must we forget that our imaginary
convoy, which has perished in the desert, has contributed
nothing to the advance of the army.
Food and clothing for the troops, tents, bedding,
guns, ammunition, field-hospital, treasury, still
await transport at the base.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the country between our frontier
and Lhasa is not all desert. Yet it is barren
enough to make it a matter of wonder that, with
such short preparation, we were able to push
through troops to Gyantse in April, when there
was no grazing on the road, and to arrive in
Lhasa in August with a force of more than 4,000
fighting men and followers.</p>

<p>Before the second advance to Gyantse the
spring crops had begun to appear. Without them
we could not have advanced. All other local
produce on the road was exhausted. That is to
say, for 160 miles, with the important exception
of wayside fodder, we subsisted entirely on our
own supplies. The mules carried their own grain,
and no more. Gyantse once reached, the Tibetan
Government granaries and stores from the monasteries
produced enough to carry us on. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
besides the transport mules, there were 100
Maxim and battery mules, as well as some 200
mounted infantry ponies, and at least 100 officers'
mounts, to be fed, and these carried nothing&mdash;contributed
nothing to the stomach of the army.</p>

<p>How were these beasts to be fed, and how was
the whole apparatus of an army to be carried
along, when every additional transport animal was
a tax on the resources of the transport? There
were two possible solutions, each at first sight
equally absurd and impracticable:&mdash;wheeled transport
in Tibet, or animals that did not require
feeding. The Supply and Transport men were
resourceful and fortunate enough to provide both.
It was due to the light ekka and that providentially
ascetic beast, the yak, that we were able to reach
Lhasa.</p>

<p>The ekkas were constructed in the plains, and
carried by coolies from the cart-road at Rungpo
eighty miles over the snow passes to Kamparab
on the Phari Plain. The carrying capacity of
these light carts is 400 pounds, two and a half
times that of a mule, and there is only one mouth
to feed. They were the first vehicles ever seen
in Tibet, and they saved the situation.</p>

<p>The ekkas worked over the Phari and Tuna
plains, and down the Nyang Chu Valley as far as
Kangma. They were supplemented by the yaks.</p>

<p>The yak is the most extraordinary animal
Nature has provided the transport officer in his
need. He carries 160 pounds, and consumes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
nothing. He subsists solely on stray blades of
grass, tamarisk, and tufts of lichen, that he picks
up on the road. He moves slowly, and wears a
look of ineffable resignation. He is the most
melancholy disillusioned beast I have seen, and
dies on the slightest provocation. The red and
white tassels and favours of cowrie-shells the
Tibetans hang about his neck are as incongruous
on the poor beast as gauds and frippery on the
heroine of a tragedy.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Yak in Ekka.</span>
</div>

<p>If only he were dependable, our transport difficulties
would be reduced to a minimum. But he
is not. We have seen how the four thousand died
in their passage across Sikkim without doing a
day's work. Local drafts did better. Yet I have
often passed the Lieutenant in command of the
corps lamenting their lack of grit. 'Two more of
my cows died this morning. Look, there goes
another! D&mdash;n the beasts! I believe they do
it out of spite!' And the chief Supply and Transport
officer, always a humorist in adversity,
when asked why they were dying off every day,
said: 'I think it must be due to overfeeding.'
But we owe much to the yak.</p>

<p>The final advance from Gyantse to Lhasa was
a comparatively easy matter. Crops were plentiful,
and large supplies of grain were obtained from
the monasteries and jongs on the road. We
found, contrary to anticipation, that the produce
in this part of Tibet was much greater than the
consumption. In many places we found stores
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that would last a village three or four years. Our
transport animals lived on the country. We
arrived at Lhasa with 2,600 mules and 400 coolies.
The yak and donkey corps were left at the river
for convoy work. It would have been impossible
to have pushed through in the winter.</p>

<p>All the produce we consumed on the road was
paid for. In this way the expense of the army's
keep fell on the Lhasa Government, who had to
pay the indemnity, and our presence in the country
was not directly, at any rate, a burden on the
agricultural population of the villages through
which we passed.</p>

<p>Looking back on the splendid work accomplished
by the transport, it is difficult to select any special
phase more memorable than another. The complete
success of the organization and the endurance
and grit displayed by officers and men are equally
admirable. I could cite the coolness of a single
officer in a mob of armed and mutinous coolies,
when the compelling will of one man and a few
blows straight from the shoulder kept the discontented
harnessed to their work and quelled
a revolt; or the case of another who drove his
diseased yaks over the snow passes into Chumbi,
and after two days' rest started with a fresh corps
on ten months of the most tedious labour the
mind of man can imagine, rising every day before
daybreak in an almost Arctic cold, traversing the
same featureless tablelands, and camping out at
night cheerfully in the open plain with his escort
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of thirty rifles. There was always the chance of
a night attack, but no other excitement to break
the eternal monotony. But it was all in the day's
work, and the subaltern took it like a picnic.
Another supreme test of endurance in man and
beast were the convoys between Chumbi and
Tuna in the early part of the year, which for
hardships endured remind me of Skobeleff's dash
through the Balkans on Adrianople. Only our
labours were protracted, Skobeleff's the struggle
of a few days. Even in mid-March a convoy of
the 12th Mule Corps, escorted by two companies
of the 23rd Pioneers, were overtaken by a blizzard
on their march between Phari and Tuna, and
camped in two feet of snow with the thermometer
18¬∞ below zero. A driving hurricane made it impossible
to light a fire or cook food. The officers
were reduced to frozen bully beef and neat spirits,
while the sepoys went without food for thirty-six
hours. The fodder for the mules was buried
deep in snow. The frozen flakes blowing through
the tents cut like a knife. While the detachment
was crossing a stream, the mules fell through the
ice, and were only extricated with great difficulty.
The drivers arrived at Tuna frozen to the waist.
Twenty men of the 12th Mule Corps were frostbitten,
and thirty men of the 23rd Pioneers were
so incapacitated that they had to be carried in on
mules. On the same day there were seventy cases
of snow-blindness among the 8th Gurkhas.</p>

<p>Until late in April all the plain was intersected
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
by frozen streams. Blankets were stripped from
the mules to make a pathway for them over the
ice. Often they went without water at night, and
at mid-day, when the surface of the ice was
melted, their thirst was so great that many died
from overdrinking.</p>

<p>Had the Tibetans attacked us in January, they
would have taken us at a great disadvantage.
The bolts of our rifles jammed with frozen oil.
Oil froze in the Maxims, and threw them out of
gear. More often than not the mounted infantry
found the butts of their rifles frozen in the buckets,
and had to dismount and use both hands to extricate
them.</p>

<p>I think these men who took the convoys through
to Tuna; the 23rd, who wintered there and supplied
most of the escort; and the 8th Gurkhas, who cut
a road in the frost-bound plain, may be said to
have broken the back of the resistance to our
advance. They were the pioneers, and the troops
who followed in spring and summer little realized
what they owed to them.</p>

<p>The great difficulties we experienced in pushing
through supplies to Tuna, which is less than 150
miles from our base railway-station at Siliguri,
show the absurdity of the idea of a Russian
advance on Lhasa. The nearest Russian outpost
is over 1,000 miles distant, and the country
to be traversed is even more barren and inhospitable
than on our frontier.</p>

<p>Up to the present the route to Chumbi has been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
vi√¢ Siliguri and the Jelap and Nathu Passes, but
the natural outlet of the valley is by the Ammo
Chu, which flows through Bhutan into the Dooars,
where it becomes the Torsa. The Bengal-Dooars
Railway now extends to Madhari Hat, fifteen miles
from the point where the Torsa crosses the frontier,
whence it is only forty-eight miles as the crow flies
to Rinchengong in the Chumbi Valley. When the
projected Ammo Chu cart-road is completed, all
the difficulty of carrying stores into Chumbi will
be obviated. Engineers are already engaged on
the first trace, and the road will be in working
order within a few months. It avoids all snow
passes, and nowhere reaches an elevation of more
than 9,000 feet. The direct route will shorten
the journey to Chumbi by several days, bring
Lhasa within a month's journey of Calcutta, and
considerably improve trade facilities between
Tibet and India.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><span>CHAPTER VI</span>

<small>THE ACTION AT THE HOT SPRINGS</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Tuna, which lies at the foot of bare
yellow hills, consists of a few deserted houses.
The place is used mainly as a halting-stage by
the Tibetans. The country around is sterile and
unproductive, and wood is a luxury that must be
carried from a distance of nearly fifty miles.</p>

<p>It was in these dismal surroundings that Colonel
Younghusband's mission spent the months of
January, February, and March. The small garrison
suffered all the discomforts of Phari. The
dirt and grime of the squalid little houses became
so depressing that they pitched their tents in an
open courtyard, preferring the numbing cold to the
filth of the Tibetan hovels. Many of the sepoys
fell victims to frost-bite and pneumonia, and nearly
every case of pneumonia proved fatal, the patient
dying of suffocation owing to the rarefied air.</p>

<p>Colonel Younghusband had not been at Tuna
many days before it became clear that there could
be no hope of a peaceful solution. The Tibetans
began to gather in large numbers at Guru, eight
miles to the east, on the road to Lhasa. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Depon, or Lhasa General, whom Colonel Younghusband
met on two occasions, repeated that he
was only empowered to treat on condition that
we withdrew to Yatung. Messages were sent
from the Tibetan camp to Tuna almost daily
asking us to retire, and negociations again came
to a deadlock. After a month the tone of the
Tibetans became minatory. They threatened to
invest our camp, and an attack was expected
on March 1, the Tibetan New Year. The Lamas,
however, thought better of it. They held a Commination
Service instead, and cursed us solemnly
for five days, hoping, no doubt, that the British
force would dwindle away by the act of God.
Nobody was 'one penny the worse.'</p>

<p>Though we made no progress with the Tibetans
during this time, Colonel Younghusband utilized
the halt at Tuna in cementing a friendship with
Bhutan. The neutrality of the Bhutanese in the
case of a war with Tibet was a matter of the
utmost importance. Were these people unfriendly
or disposed to throw in their lot with their co-religionists,
the Tibetans, our line of communications
would be exposed to a flank attack along the
whole of the Tuna Plain, which is conterminous
with the Bhutan frontier, as well as a rear attack
anywhere in the Chumbi Valley as far south as
Rinchengong. The Bhutanese are men of splendid
physique, brave, warlike, and given to pillage.
Their hostility would have involved the despatch
of a second force, as large as that sent to Tibet,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and might have landed us, if unprepared, in a
serious reverse. The complete success of Colonel
Younghusband's diplomacy was a great relief to
the Indian Government, who were waiting with
some anxiety to see what attitude the Bhutanese
would adopt. Having secured from them assurances
of their good will, Colonel Younghusband
put their friendship to immediate test by broaching
the subject of the Ammo Chu route to Chumbi
through Bhutanese territory. Very little time
was lost before the concession was obtained from
the Tongsa Penlop, ruler of Bhutan, who himself
accompanied the mission as far as Lhasa in the
character of mediator between the Dalai Lama
and the British Government. The importance
of the Ammo Chu route in our future relations
with Tibet I have emphasized elsewhere.</p>

<p>I doubt if ever an advance was more welcome
to waiting troops than that which led to the
engagement at the Hot Springs.</p>

<p>For months, let it be remembered, we had been
marking time. When a move had to be made to
escort a convoy, it was along narrow mountain-paths,
where the troops had to march in single
file. There was no possibility of an attack this
side of Phari. The ground covered was familiar
and monotonous. One felt cooped in, and was
thoroughly bored and tired of the delay, so that
when General Macdonald marched out of Phari
with his little army in three columns, a feeling of
exhilaration communicated itself to the troops.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was elbow-room at last, and an open
plain, where all the army corps of Europe might
man&oelig;uvre. At Tuna, on the evening of the 29th,
it was given out in orders that a reconnaissance
in force was to be made the next morning, and
two companies of the 32nd Pioneers would be left
at Guru. The Tibetan camp at the Hot Springs
lay right across our line of march, and the hill that
flanked it was lined with their sangars. They must
either fight or retire. Most of us thought that
the Tibetans would fade away in the mysterious
manner they have, and build another futile wall
further on. The extraordinary affair that followed
must be a unique event in military history.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/fp102s.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />The Depon's Last Conference with Colonel Younghusband.</span>
</div>

<p>The morning of the 30th was bitterly cold. An
icy wind was blowing, and snow was lying on the
ground. I put on my thick sheepskin for the
first time for two months, and I owe my life to it.</p>

<p>About an hour after leaving Tuna, two or three
Tibetan messengers rode out from their camp to
interview Colonel Younghusband. They got down
from their ponies and began chattering in a very
excited manner, like a flock of frightened parrots.
It was evident to us, not understanding the language,
that they were entreating us to go back,
and the constant reference to Yatung told us that
they were repeating the message that had been
sent into the Tuna camp almost daily during the
past few months&mdash;that if we retired to Yatung
the Dalai Lama would send an accredited envoy
to treat with us. Being met with the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
answer, they mounted dejectedly and rode off
at a gallop to their camp.</p>

<p>Soon after they had disappeared another group
of horsemen were seen riding towards us. These
proved to be the Lhasa Depon, accompanied by
an influential Lama and a small escort armed with
modern rifles. The rifles were naturally inspected
with great interest. They were of different
patterns&mdash;Martini-Henri, Lee-Metford, Snider&mdash;but
the clumsily-painted stocks alone were enough
to show that they were shoddy weapons of native
manufacture. They left no mark on our troops.</p>

<p>According to Tibetan custom, a rug was spread
on the ground for the interview between Colonel
Younghusband and the Lhasa Depon, who
conferred sitting down. Captain O'Connor, the
secretary of the mission, interpreted. The Lhasa
Depon repeated the entreaty of the messengers,
and said that there would be trouble if we proceeded.
Colonel Younghusband's reply was terse
and to the point.</p>

<p>'Tell him,' he said to Captain O'Connor, 'that
we have been negociating with Tibet for fifteen
years; that I myself have been waiting for eight
months to meet responsible representatives from
Lhasa, and that the mission is now going on to
Gyantse. Tell him that we have no wish to fight,
and that he would be well advised if he ordered
his soldiers to retire. Should they remain blocking
our path, I will ask General Macdonald to
remove them.'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lhasa Depon was greatly perturbed. He
said that he had no wish to fight, and would try
and stop his men firing upon us. But before he
left he again tried to induce Colonel Younghusband
to turn back. Then he rode away to join his
men. What orders he gave them will never be
known.</p>

<p>I do not think the Tibetans ever believed in our
serious intention to advance. No doubt they
attributed our evacuation of Khamba Jong and
our long delay in Chumbi to weakness and vacillation.
And our forbearance since the negociations
of 1890 must have lent itself to the same interpretation.</p>

<p>As we advanced we could see the Tibetans running
up the hill to the left to occupy the sangars.
To turn their position, General Macdonald deployed
the 8th Gurkhas to the crest of the ridge;
at the same time the Pioneers, the Maxim detachment
of the Norfolks, and Mountain Battery
were deployed on the right until the Tibetan
position was surrounded.</p>

<p>The man&oelig;uvre was completely successful. The
Tibetans on the hill, finding themselves outflanked
by the Gurkhas, ran down to the cover of the wall
by the main camp, and the whole mob was encircled
by our troops.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that the Sikhs and
Gurkhas displayed that coolness and discipline
which won them a European reputation. They
had orders not to fire unless they were fired upon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and they walked right up to the walls of the sangars
until the muzzles and prongs of the Tibetan matchlocks
were almost touching their chests. The
Tibetans stared at our men for a moment across
the wall, and then turned and shambled down
sulkily to join their comrades in the redan.</p>

<p>No one dreamed of the sanguinary action
that was impending. I dismounted, and hastily
scribbled a despatch on my saddle to the effect
that the Tibetan position had been taken without
a shot being fired. The mounted orderly who
carried the despatch bore a similar message from
the mission to the Foreign Office. Then the disarming
began. The Tibetans were told that if
they gave up their arms they would be allowed to
go off unmolested. But they did not wish to give
up their arms. It was a ridiculous position, Sikh
and Mongol swaying backwards and forwards as
they wrestled for the possession of swords and
matchlocks. Perhaps the humour of it made one
careless of the underlying danger. Accounts differ
as to how this wrestling match developed into
war, how, to the delight of the troops, the toy
show became the 'real thing.' Of one thing I
am certain, that a rush was made in the south-east
corner before a shot was fired. If there had
been any firing, I would not have been wandering
about by the Tibetan flank without a revolver in
my hand. As it was, my revolver was buried in
the breast pocket of my Norfolk jacket under my
poshteen.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>I have no excuse for this folly except a misplaced
contempt for Tibetan arms and courage&mdash;a
contempt which accounted for our only serious
casualty in the affair of 1888.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Also I think there
was in the margin of my consciousness a feeling
that one individual by an act of rashness might
make himself responsible for the lives of hundreds.
Hemmed in as the Tibetans were, no one gave
them credit for the spirit they showed, or imagined
that they would have the folly to resist. But we
had to deal with the most ignorant and benighted
people on earth, most of whom must have thought
our magazine rifles and Maxims as harmless as
their own obsolete matchlocks, and believed that
they bore charms by which they were immune
from death.</p>

<p>The attack on the south-east corner was so
sudden that the first man was on me before I had
time to draw my revolver.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He came at me with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
his sword lifted in both hands over his head. He
had a clear run of ten yards, and if I had not
ducked and caught him by the knees he must
have smashed my skull open. I threw him, and
he dragged me to the ground. Trying to rise, I
was struck on the temple by a second swordsman,
and the blade glanced off my skull. I received
the rest of my wounds, save one or two, on my
hands&mdash;as I lay on my face I used them to protect
my head. After a time the blows ceased;
my assailants were all shot down or had fled. I
lay absolutely still for a while until I thought it
safe to raise my head. Then I looked round, and,
seeing no Tibetans near in an erect position, I got
up and walked out of the ring between the rifles
of the Sikhs. The firing line had been formed in
the meantime on a mound about thirty yards
behind me, and I had been exposed to the bullets
of our own men from two sides, as well as the
promiscuous fire of the Tibetans.</p>

<p>The Tibetans could not have chosen a spot more
fatal for their stand&mdash;a bluff hill to the north, a
marsh and stream on the east, and to the west a
stone wall built across the path, which they had
to scale in their attempted assault on General
Macdonald and his escort. Only one man got
over. Inside there was barely an acre of ground,
packed so thickly with seething humanity that
the cross-fire which the Pioneers poured in offered
little danger to their own men.</p>

<p>The Lhasa General must have fired off his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
revolver after I was struck down. I cannot credit
the rumour that his action was a signal for a
general attack, and that the Tibetans allowed
themselves to be herded together as a ruse to
get us at close quarters. To begin with, the demand
that they should give up their arms, and
the assurance that they might go off unmolested,
must have been quite unexpected by them, and
I doubt if they realized the advantage of an attack
at close quarters.</p>

<p>My own impression is that the shot was the act
of a desperate man, ignorant and regardless of
what might ensue. To return to Lhasa with his
army disarmed and disbanded, and without a shot
having been fired, must have meant ruin to him,
and probably death. When we reached Gyantse
we heard that his property had been confiscated
from his family on account of his failure to prevent
our advance.</p>

<p>The Depon was a man of fine presence and
bearing. I only saw him once, in his last interview
with Colonel Younghusband, but I cannot
dissociate from him a personal courage and a
pride that must have rankled at the indignity of
his position. Probably he knew that his shot was
suicidal.</p>

<p>The action has been described as one of extreme
folly. But what was left him if he lived except
shame and humiliation? And what Englishman
with the same prospect to face, caught in this
dark eddy of circumstance, would not have done
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the same thing? He could only fire, and let his
men take their chance, God help them!</p>

<p>And the rabble? They have been called
treacherous. Why, I don't know. They were
mostly impressed peasants. They did not wish to
give up their arms. Why should they? They knew
nothing of the awful odds against them. They
were being hustled by white men who did not
draw knives or fire guns. Amid that babel of
1,500 men, many of them may not have heard the
command; they may not have believed that their
lives would have been spared.</p>

<p>Looking back on the affair with all the sanity
of experience, nothing is more natural than what
happened. It was folly and suicide, no doubt;
but it was human nature. They were not going
to give in without having a fling. I hope I shall
not be considered a pro-Tibetan when I say that
I admire their gallantry and dash.</p>

<p>As my wounds were being dressed I peered over
the mound at the rout. They were walking away!
Why, in the name of all their Bodhisats and
Munis, did they not run? There was cover behind
a bend in the hill a few hundred yards distant,
and they were exposed to a devastating hail
of bullets from the Maxims and rifles, that seemed
to mow down every third or fourth man. Yet
they walked!</p>

<p>It was the most extraordinary procession I have
ever seen. My friends have tried to explain the
phenomenon as due to obstinacy or ignorance, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Spartan contempt for life. But I think I have the
solution. They were bewildered. The impossible
had happened.</p>

<p>Prayers, and charms, and mantras, and the
holiest of their holy men, had failed them. I
believe they were obsessed with that one thought.
They walked with bowed heads, as if they had
been disillusioned in their gods.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Diagrammatic View of Hot Springs Action.</span>
</div>

<p>After the last of the retiring Tibetans had disappeared
round the corner of the Guru road, the
8th Gurkhas descended from the low range of hills
on the right of the position, and crossed the Guru
Plain in extended order with the 2nd Mounted
Infantry on their extreme left. Orders were then
received by Major Row, commanding the detachment,
to take the left of the two houses which
were situated under the hills at the further side
of the plain. This movement was carried out in
conjunction with the mounted infantry. The
advance was covered by the 7-pounder guns
of the Gurkhas under Captain Luke, R.A. The
attacking force advanced in extended order by a
series of small rushes. Cover was scanty, but the
Tibetans, though firing vigorously, fired high, and
there were no casualties. At last the force reached
the outer wall of the house, and regained breath
under cover of it. A few men of the Gurkhas
then climbed on to the roof and descended into
the house, making prisoners of the inmates, who
numbered forty or fifty. Shortly afterwards the
door, which was strongly barricaded, was broken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in, and the remainder of the force entered the
house.</p>

<p>During the advance a number of the Tibetans
attempted to escape on mules and ponies, but
the greater number of these were followed up and
killed. The Tibetan casualties were at least 700.</p>

<p>Perhaps no British victory has been greeted
with less enthusiasm than the action at the Hot
Springs. Certainly the officers, who did their
duty so thoroughly, had no heart in the business
at all. After the first futile rush the Tibetans
made no further resistance. There was no
more fighting, only the slaughter of helpless
men.</p>

<p>It is easy to criticise after the event, but it
seems to me that the only way to have avoided
the lamentable affair at the Hot Springs would
have been to have drawn up more troops round
the redan, and, when the Tibetans were hemmed
in with the cliff in their rear, to have given them
at least twenty minutes to lay down their arms.
In the interval the situation might have been
made clear to everyone. If after the time-limit
they still hesitated, two shots might have brought
them to reason. Then, if they were mad enough
to decide on resistance, their suicide would be on
their own heads. But to send two dozen sepoys
into that sullen mob to take away their arms was
to invite disaster. Given the same circumstances,
and any mob in the world of men, women, or
children, civilized or savage, and there would be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
found at least one rash spirit to explode the mine
and set a spark to a general conflagration.</p>

<p>It was thought at the time that the lesson
would save much future bloodshed. But the
Tibetan is so stubborn and convinced of his self-sufficiency
that it took many lessons to teach him
the disparity between his armed rabble and the
resources of the British Raj. In the light of after-events
it is clear that we could have made no
progress without inflicting terrible punishment.
The slaughter at Guru only forestalled the inevitable.
We were drawn into the vortex of war by
the Tibetans' own folly. There was no hope of
their regarding the British as a formidable Power,
and a force to be reckoned with, until we had killed
several thousand of their men.</p>

<p>After the action the Tibetan wounded were
brought into Tuna, and an abandoned dwelling-house
was fitted up as a hospital. An empty
cowshed outside served as an operating-theatre.
The patients showed extraordinary hardihood and
stoicism. After the Dzama Tang engagement
many of the wounded came in riding on yaks from
a distance of fifty or sixty miles. They were consistently
cheerful, and always ready to appreciate
a joke. One man, who lost both legs, said: 'In
my next battle I must be a hero, as I cannot run
away.' Some of the wounded were terribly mutilated
by shell. Two men who were shot through
the brain, and two who were shot through the
lungs, survived. For two days Lieutenant Davys,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Indian Medical Service, was operating nearly all
day. I think the Tibetans were really impressed
with our humanity, and looked upon Davys as
some incarnation of a medicine Buddha. They
never hesitated to undergo operations, did not
flinch at pain, and took chloroform without fear.
Their recuperative power was marvellous. Of
the 168 who were received in hospital, only 20
died; 148 were sent to their homes on hired yaks
cured. Everyone who visited the hospital at
Tuna left it with an increased respect for the
Tibetans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three months after the action I found the
Tibetans still lying where they fell. One shot
through the shoulder in retreat had spun as he
fell facing our rifles. Another tore at the grass
with futile fingers through which a delicate pink
primula was now blossoming. Shrunk arms and
shanks looked hideously dwarfish. By the stream
the bodies lay in heaps with parched skin, like
mummies, rusty brown. A knot of coarse black
hair, detached from a skull, was circling round in
an eddy of wind. Everything had been stripped
from the corpses save here and there a wisp of
cloth, looking more grim than the nakedness it
covered, or round the neck some inexpensive
charm, which no one had thought worth taking
for its occult powers. Nature, more kindly, had
strewn round them beautiful spring flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&mdash;primulas,
buttercups, potentils. The stream
'bubbled oilily,' and in the ruined house bees
were swarming.</p>

<p>Ten miles beyond the Springs an officer was
watering his horse in the Bamtso Lake. The
beast swung round trembling, with eyes astare.
Among the weeds lay the last victim.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><span>CHAPTER VII</span>

<small>A HUMAN MISCELLANY</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Tibetans stood on the roofs of their houses
like a row of cormorants, and watched the doolie
pass underneath. At a little distance it was hard
to distinguish the children, so motionless were
they, from the squat praying-flags wrapped in
black skin and projecting from the parapets of
the roof. The very babes were impassive and
inscrutable. Beside them perched ravens of an
ebony blackness, sleek and well groomed, and so
consequential that they seemed the most human
element of the group.</p>

<p>My Tibetan bearers stopped to converse with
a woman on the roof who wore a huge red hoop in
her hair, which was matted and touzled like a
negress's. A child behind was searching it, with
apparent success. The woman asked a question,
and the bearers jerked out a few guttural monosyllables,
which she received with indifference.
She was not visibly elated when she heard that
the doolie contained the first victim of the Tibetan
arms. I should like to have heard her views on
the political situation and the question of a settlement.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Some of her relatives, perhaps, were
killed in the m√™l√©e at the Hot Springs. Others
who had been taken prisoners might be enlisted
in the new doolie corps, and receiving an unexpected
wage; others, perhaps, were wounded
and being treated in our hospitals with all the
skill and resources of modern science; or they
were bringing in food-stuffs for our troops, or
setting booby-traps for them, and lying in wait
behind sangars to snipe them in the Red Idol
Gorge.</p>

<p>The bearers started again; the hot sun and
the continued exertion made them stink intolerably.
Every now and then they put down the
doolie, and began discussing their loot&mdash;ear-rings
and charms, rough turquoises and ruby-coloured
stones, torn from the bodies of the dead and
wounded. For the moment I was tired of Tibet.</p>

<p>I remembered another exodus when I was disgusted
with the country. I had been allured
across the Himalayas by the dazzling purity of
the snows. I had escaped the Avernus of the
plains, and I might have been content, but there
was the seduction of the snows. I had gained an
upper story, but I must climb on to the roof.
Every morning the Sun-god threw open the magnificent
portals of his domain, dazzling rifts and
spires, black cliffs glacier-bitten, the flawless
vaulted roof of Kinchenjunga&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Myriads of topaz lights and jacinth work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of subtlest jewellery.'<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></div></div>

<p>One morning the roof of the Sun-god's palace
was clear and cloudless, but about its base hung
little clouds of snow-dust, as though the Olympians
had been holding tourney, and the dust had risen
in the tracks of their chariots. All this was seen
over galvanized iron roofs. The Sun-god had
thrown open his palace, and we were playing pitch
and toss on the steps. While I was so engrossed
I looked up. Columns of white cloud were rising
to obscure the entrance. Then a sudden shaft
of sunlight broke the fumes. There was a vivid
flash, a dazzle of jewel-work, and the portals
closed. I was covered with bashfulness and
shame. It was a direct invitation. I made some
excuse to my companion, said I had an engagement,
went straight to my rooms, and packed.</p>

<p>But while the aroma of my carriers insulted
the pure air, and their chatter over their tawdry
spoil profaned the silent precincts of Chumulari,
their mountain goddess, I thought more of the disenchantment
of that earlier visit. I remembered
sitting on a hillside near a lamasery, which was
surrounded by a small village of Lamas' houses.
Outside the temple a priest was operating on a
yak for vaccine. He had bored a large hole in
the shoulder, into which he alternately buried his
forearm and squirted hot water copiously. A
hideous yellow trickle beneath indicated that the
poor beast was entirely perforated. A crowd of
admiring little boys and girls looked on with
relish. The smell of the poor yak was distressing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
but the smell of the Lama was worse. I turned
away in disgust&mdash;turned my back contentedly
and without regret on the mysterious land and
the road to the Forbidden City. At that moment,
if the Dalai Lama himself had sent me a chaise
with a dozen outriders and implored me to come,
I would not have visited him, not for a thousand
yaks. The scales of vagabondage fell from my
eyes; the spirit of unrest died within me. I had
a longing for fragrant soap, snowy white linen,
fresh-complexioned ladies and clean-shaven, well-groomed
men.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Field-Hospital Doolie with Tibetan Bearers.</span>
</div>

<p>And here again I was returning very slowly to
civilization; but I was coming back with half an
army corps to shake the Dalai Lama on his throne&mdash;or
if there were no throne or Dalai Lama, to do
what? I wondered if the gentlemen sitting
snugly in Downing Street had any idea.</p>

<p>At Phari I was snow-bound for a week, and
there were no doolie-bearers. The Darjeeling
dandy-wallahs were no doubt at the front, where
they were most wanted, as the trained army
doolie corps are plainsmen, who can barely
breathe, much less work, at these high elevations.
At last we secured some Bhutias who were
returning to the front.</p>

<p>The Bhutia is a type I have long known, though
not in the capacity of bearer. These men regarded
the doolie with the invalid inside as a piece
of baggage that had to be conveyed from one
camp to another, no matter how. Of the art of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
their craft they knew nothing, but they battled
with the elements so stoutly that one forgave
them their awkwardness. They carried me along
mountain-paths so slippery that a mule could find
no foothold, through snow so deep and clogging
that with all their toil they could make barely
half a mile an hour; and they took shelter once
from a hailstorm in which exposure without thick
head-covering might have been fatal. Often they
dropped the doolie, sometimes on the edge of a
precipice, in places where one perspired with
fright; they collided quite unnecessarily with
stones and rocks; but they got through, and
that was the main point. Men who have carried
a doolie over a difficult mountain-pass (14,350 feet),
slipping and stumbling through snow and ice in
the face of a hurricane of wind, deserve well of
the great Raj which they serve.</p>

<p>On the road into Darjeeling, owing to the
absence of trained doolie-bearers, I met a human
miscellany that I am not likely to forget. Eight
miles beyond the Jelap lies the fort of Gnatong,
whence there is a continual descent to the plains
of India. The neighbouring hills and valleys had
been searched for men; high wages were offered,
and at last from some remote village in Sikkim
came a dozen weedy Lepchas, simian in appearance,
and of uncouth speech, who understood no
civilized tongue. They had never seen a doolie,
but in default of better they were employed. It
was nobody's fault; bearers must be had, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the profession was unpopular. I was their 'first
job.' I settled myself comfortably, all unconscious
of my impending fate. They started off
with a wild whoop, threw the doolie up in the air,
caught it on their shoulders, and played cup and
ball with the contents until they were tired. I
swore at them in Spanish, English, and Hindustani,
but it was small relief, as they didn't take
the slightest notice, and I had neither hands to
beat them nor feet to kick them over the <i>khud</i>.
My orderly followed and told them in a mild
North-Country accent that they would be punished
if they did it again; there is some absurd army
regulation about British soldiers striking followers.
For all they knew, he was addressing the stars.
They dropped the thing a dozen times in ten miles,
and thought it the hugest joke in the world. I
shall shy at a hospital doolie for the rest of my
natural life.</p>

<p>There is a certain Mongol smell which is the
most unpleasant human odour I know. It is
common to Lepchas, Bhutanese, and Tibetans,
but it is found in its purest essence in these low-country,
cross-bred Lepchas, who were my close
companions for two days. When we reached the
heat of the valley, they jumped into the stream
and bathed, but they emerged more unsavoury
than ever. It was a relief to pass a dead mule.
At the next village they got drunk, after which
they developed an amazing surefootedness, and
carried me in without mishap.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>After two days with my Lepchas we reached
Rungli (2,000 feet), whence the road to the plains
is almost level. Here a friend introduced me to
a Jemadar in a Gurkha regiment.</p>

<p>'He writes all about our soldiers and the
fighting in Tibet,' he said. 'It all goes home
to England on the telegraph-wire, and people at
home are reading what he says an hour or two
after he has given <i>khubber</i> to the office here.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said the Jemadar in Hindustani, 'and
if things are well the people in England will be
very glad; and if we are ill and die, and there is
too much cold, they will be very sorry.'</p>

<p>The Jemadar smiled. He was most sincere
and sympathetic. If an Englishman had said the
same thing, he would have been thought half-witted,
but Orientals have a way of talking platitudes
as if they were epigrams.</p>

<p>The Jemadar's speech was so much to the point
that it called up a little picture in my mind of
the London Underground and a liveried official
dealing out <i>Daily Mails</i> to crowds of inquirers
anxious for news of Tibet. Only the sun blazed
overhead and the stream made music at our feet.</p>

<p>I left the little rest-hut in the morning, resigned
to the inevitable jolting, and expecting another
promiscuous collection of humanity to do duty as
<i>kahars</i>. But, to my great joy, I found twelve
Lucknow doolie-wallahs waiting by the veranda,
lithe and erect, and part of a drilled corps. Drill
discipline is good, but in the art of their trade
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
these men needed no teaching. For centuries
their ancestors had carried palanquins in the
plains, bearing Rajas and ladies of high estate,
perhaps even the Great Mogul himself. The running
step to their strange rhythmic chants must
be an instinct to them. That morning I knew
my troubles were at an end. They started off
with steps of velvet, improvising as they went a
kind of plaintive song like an intoned litany.</p>

<p>The leading man chanted a dimeter line,
generally with an iambus in the first foot; but
when the road was difficult or the ascent toilsome,
the metre became trochaic, in accordance with
the best traditions of classical poetry. The hind-men
responded with a sing-song trochaic dimeter
which sounded like a long-drawn-out monosyllable.
They never initiated anything. It was
not custom; it had never been done. The laws
of Nature are not so immutable as the ritual of a
Hindu guild.</p>

<p>We sped on smoothly for eight miles, and when
I asked the <i>kahars</i> if they were tired, they said
they would not rest, as relays were waiting on the
road. All the way they chanted their hymn of
the obvious:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mountains are steep;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Chorus</i>: Yes, they are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The road is narrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, it is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sahib is wounded;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That is so.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many wounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They are many.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The road goes down;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, it does.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now we are hurrying;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, we are.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here they ran swiftly till the next rise in the hill.</p>

<p>Waiting in the shade for relays, I heard two
Englishmen meet on the road. One had evidently
been attached, and was going down to join his
regiment; the other was coming up on special
service. I caught fragments of our crisp expressive
argot.</p>

<p><i>Officer going down</i> (<i>apparently disillusioned</i>):
'Oh, it's the same old bald-headed maidan we
usually muddle into.'</p>

<p><i>Officer coming up</i>: '... Up above Phari ideal
country for native cavalry, isn't it?... A few
men with lances prodding those fellows in the
back would soon put the fear of God into them.
Why don't they send up the &mdash;th Light Cavalry?'</p>

<p><i>Officer going down</i>: 'They've Walers, and you
can't feed 'em, and the &mdash;th are all Jats. They're
no good; can't do without a devil of a lot of milk.
They want bucketsful of it. Well, bye-bye;
you'll soon get fed up with it.'</p>

<p>The doolie was hitched up, and the <i>kahars</i> resumed
their chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A sahib goes up;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, he does.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sahib goes down;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That is so.'<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The heat and the monotonous cadence induced
drowsiness, and one fell to thinking of this odd
motley of men, all of one genus, descended from
the anthropoid ape, and exhibiting various phases
of evolution&mdash;the primitive Lepcha, advanced
little further than his domestic dog; the Tibetan
<i>kahar</i> caught in the wheel of civilization, and
forming part of the mechanism used to bring his
own people into line; the Lucknow doolie-bearer
and the Jemadar Sahib, products of a hoary
civilization that have escaped complexity and
nerves; and lord of all these, by virtue of his
race, the most evolved, the English subaltern.
All these folk are brought together because the
people on the other side of the hills will insist on
being obsolete anachronisms, who have been asleep
for hundreds of years while we have been developing
the sense of our duty towards our neighbour.
They must come into line; it is the will of the
most evolved.</p>

<p>The next day I was carried for miles through a
tropical forest. The damp earth sweated in the
sun after last night's thunder-storm, and the
vegetation seemed to grow visibly in the steaming
moisture. Gorgeous butterflies, the epicures of a
season, came out to indulge a love of sunshine and
suck nectar from all this profusion. Overhead,
birds shrieked and whistled and beat metal, and
did everything but sing. The cicadas raised a
deafening din in praise of their Maker, seeming to
think, in their natural egoism, that He had made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the forest, oak, and gossamer for their sakes. We
were not a thousand feet above the sea. Thousands
of feet above us, where we were camping a
day or two ago, our troops were marching through
snow.</p>

<p>The next morning we crossed the Tista River,
and the road led up through sal forests to a tea-garden
at 3,500 feet. Here we entered the most
perfect climate in the world, and I enjoyed genial
hospitality and a foretaste of civilization: a bed,
sheets, a warm bath, clean linen, fruit, sparkling
soda, a roomy veranda with easy-chairs, and outside
roses and trellis-work, and a garden bright
with orchids and wild-turmeric and a profusion of
semi-tropical and English flowers&mdash;all the things
which the spoilt children of civilization take as a
matter of course, because they have never slept
under the stars, or known what it is to be hungry
and cold, or exhausted by struggling against the
forces of untamed Nature.</p>

<p>At noon next day, in the cantonments at Jelapahar,
an officer saw a strange sight&mdash;a field-hospital
doolie with the red cross, and twelve
<i>kahars</i>, Lucknow men, whose plaintive chant
must have recalled old days on the North-West
frontier. Behind on a mule rode a British orderly
of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, bearded and
weather-stained, and without a trace of the spick-and-spanness
of cantonments. I saw the officer's
face lighten; he became visibly excited; he could
not restrain himself&mdash;he swung round, rode after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
my orderly, and began to question him without
shame. Here was civilization longing for the
wilderness, and over there, beyond the mist,
under that snow-clad peak, were men in the
wilderness longing for civilization.</p>

<p>A cloud swept down and obscured the Jelap, as
if the chapter were closed. But it is not. That
implacable barrier must be crossed again, and
then, when we have won the most secret places
of the earth, we may cry with Burton and his
Arabs, 'Voyaging is victory!'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> intention of the Tibetans at the Hot Springs
has not been made clear. They say that their
orders were to oppose our advance, but to avoid
a battle, just as our orders were to take away
their arms, if possible, without firing a shot. The
muddle that ensued lends itself to several interpretations,
and the Tibetans ascribe their loss to
British treachery. They say that we ordered them
to destroy the fuses of their matchlocks, and then
fired on them. This story was taken to Lhasa,
with the result that the new levies from the
capital were not deterred by the terrible punishment
inflicted on their comrades. Orders were
given to oppose us on the road to Gyantse, and
an armed force, which included many of the
fugitives from Guru, gathered about Kangma.</p>

<p>The peace delegates always averred that we
fired the first shot at Guru. But even if we give
the Tibetans the benefit of the doubt, and admit
that the action grew out of the natural excitement
of two forces struggling for arms, both of whom
were originally anxious to avoid a conflict, there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is still no doubt that the responsibility of continuing
the hostilities lies with the Tibetans.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 7 ten scouts of the
2nd Mounted Infantry, under Captain Peterson,
found the Tibetans occupying the village of Samando,
seventeen miles beyond Kalatso. As our
men had orders not to fire or provoke an attack,
they sent a messenger up to the walls to ask one
of the Tibetans to come out and parley. They
said they would send for a man, and invited us
to come nearer. When we had ridden up to
within a hundred yards of the village, they opened
a heavy fire on us with their matchlocks. Our
scouts spread out, rode back a few hundred yards,
and took cover behind stones. Not a man or
pony was hit. Before retiring, the mounted infantry
fired a few volleys at the Tibetans who
were lining the roofs of two large houses and a
wall that connected them, their heads only appearing
above the low turf parapets. Twice the
Tibetans sent off a mounted man for reinforcements,
but our shooting was so good that each
time the horse returned riderless. The next
morning we found the village unoccupied, and discovered
six dead left on the roofs, most of whom
were wounded about the chest. Our bullets had
penetrated the two feet of turf and killed the man
behind. Putting aside the question of Guru, the
Samando affair was the first overt act of hostility
directed against the mission.</p>

<p>After Samando there was no longer any doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
that the Tibetans intended to oppose our advance.
On the 8th the mounted infantry discovered a
wall built across the valley and up the hills just
this side of Kangma, which they reported as
occupied by about 1,000 men. As it was too late
to attack that night, we formed camp. The next
morning we found the wall evacuated, and the
villagers reported that the Tibetans had retired
to the gorge below. This habit of building formidable
barriers across a valley, stretching from
crest to crest of the flanking hills, is a well-known
trait of Tibetan warfare. The wall is often built
in the night and abandoned the next morning.
One would imagine that, after toiling all night to
make a strong position, the Tibetans would hold
their wall if they intended to make a stand
anywhere. But they do not grudge the labour.
Wall-building is an instinct with them. When a
Tibetan sees two stones by the roadside, he cannot
resist placing one on the top of the other.
So wherever one goes the whole countryside is
studded with these monuments of wasted labour,
erected to propitiate the genii of the place, or
from mere force of habit to while away an idle
hour. During the campaign of 1888 it was this
practice of strengthening and abandoning positions
more than anything else which gained the
Tibetans the reputation of cowardice, which they
have since shown to be totally undeserved.</p>

<p>On April 8, owing to the delay in reconnoitring
the wall, we made only about eight miles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
camped. The next morning we had marched
about two miles, when we found the high ridge
on the left flank occupied by the enemy, and the
mounted infantry reported them in the gorge
beyond. Two companies of the 8th Gurkhas
under Major Row were sent up to the hill on
the left to turn the enemy's right flank, and the
mountain battery (No. 7) came into action on
the right at over 3,000 yards. The enemy kept
up a continuous but ineffectual fire from the
ridge, none of their jingal bullets falling anywhere
near us. The Gurkhas had a very difficult climb.
The hill was quite 2,000 feet above the valley;
the lower and a good deal of the other slopes were
of coarse sand mixed with shale, and the rest
nothing but slippery rock. The summit of the
hill was approached by a number of step-like
shale terraces covered with snow. When only
a short way up, a snowstorm came on and obscured
the Gurkhas from view. The cold was
intense, and the troops in the valley began to
collect the sparse brushwood, and made fires to
keep themselves warm.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Wounded Tibetan in British Hospital.</span>
</div>

<p>On account of the nature of the hillside and the
high altitude, the progress of the Gurkhas was very
slow, and it took them nearly three hours to reach
the ridge held by the enemy. When about two-thirds
of the way up, they came under fire from
the ridge, but all the shots went high. The
jingals carried well over them at about 1,200
yards. The enemy also sent a detachment to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
meet them on the top, but these did not fire long,
and retired as the Gurkhas advanced. When the
8th reached the summit, the Tibetans were in full
flight down the opposite slope, which was also
snow-covered. Thirty were shot down in the
rout, and fifty-four who were hiding in the caves
were made prisoners.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the battery had been making
very good practice at 3,000 yards. Seven men
were found dead on the summit, and four wounded,
evidently by their fire.</p>

<p>But to return to the main action in the gorge.
The Tibetans held a very strong position among
some loose boulders on the right, two miles beyond
the gully which the Gurkhas had ascended to
make their flank attack. The rocks extended
from the bluff cliff to the path which skirted the
stream. No one could ask for better cover; it
was most difficult to distinguish the drab-coated
Tibetans who lay concealed there. To attack this
strong position General Macdonald sent Captain
Bethune with one company of the 32nd Pioneers,
placing Lieutenant Cook with his Maxim on a
mound at 500 yards to cover Bethune's advance.
Bethune led a frontal attack. The Tibetans fired
wildly until the Sikhs were within eighty yards, and
then fled up the valley. Not a single man of the
32nd was hit during the attack, though one sepoy
was wounded in the pursuit by a bullet in the
hand from a man who lay concealed behind a
rock within a few yards of him. While the 32nd
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
were dislodging the Tibetans from the path and
the rocks above it, the mounted infantry galloped
through them to reconnoitre ahead and cut off
the fugitives in the valley. They also came
through the enemy's fire at very close quarters
without a casualty. On emerging from the gorge
the mounted infantry discovered that the ridge
the Tibetans had held was shaped like the letter
S, so that by doubling back along an almost
parallel valley they were able to intercept the
enemy whom the Gurkhas had driven down the
cliffs. The unfortunate Tibetans were now
hemmed in between two fires, and hardly a
man of them escaped.</p>

<p>The Tibetan casualties, as returned at the time,
were much exaggerated. The killed amounted
to 100, and, on the principle that the proportion
of wounded must be at least two to one, it
was estimated that their losses were 300. But,
as a matter of fact, the wounded could not have
numbered more than two dozen.</p>

<p>The prisoners taken by the Gurkhas on the top
of the ridge turned out to be impressed peasants,
who had been compelled to fight us by the Lamas.
They were not soldiers by inclination or instinct,
and I believe their greatest fear was that they
might be released and driven on to fight us again.</p>

<p>The action at the Red Idol Gorge may be regarded
as the end of the first phase of the Tibetan
opposition. We reached Gyantse on April 11,
and the fort was surrendered without resistance.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Nothing had occurred on the march up to disturb
our estimate of the enemy. Since the campaign
of 1888 no one had given the Tibetans any credit
for martial instincts, and until the Karo la action
and the attack on Gyantse they certainly displayed
none. It would be hard to exaggerate the
strategical difficulties of the country through
which we had to pass. The progress of the
mission and its escort under similar conditions
would have been impossible on the North-West
frontier or in any country inhabited by a people
with the rudiments of sense or spirit. The difficulties
of transport were so great that the escort
had to be cut down to the finest possible figure.
There were barely enough men for pickets, and
many of the ordinary precautions of field man&oelig;uvres
were out of the question. But the Tibetan
failed to realize his opportunities. He avoided
the narrow forest-clad ravines of Sikkim and
Chumbi, and made his first stand on the open
plateau at Guru. Fortunately for us, he never
learnt what transport means to a civilized army.
A bag of barley-meal, some weighty degchies, and
a massive copper teapot slung over the saddle are
all he needs; evening may produce a sheep or a
yak. His movements are not hampered by supplies.
If the importance of the transport question
had ever entered his head, he would have
avoided the Tuna camp, with its Maxims and
mounted infantry, and made a dash upon the
line of communications. A band of hardy mountaineers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in their own country might very easily
surprise and annihilate an ill-guarded convoy in
a narrow valley thickly forested and flanked by
steep hills. To furtively cut an artery in your
enemy's arm and let out the blood is just as
effective as to knock him on the head from in
front. But in this first phase of the operations
the Tibetans showed no strategy; they were
badly led, badly armed, and apparently devoid
of all soldier-like qualities. Only on one or two
occasions they displayed a desperate and fatal
courage, and this new aspect of their character
was the first indication that we might have to
revise the views we had formed sixteen years
ago of an enemy who has seemed to us since
a unique exception to the rule that a hardy
mountain people are never deficient in courage
and the instinct of self-defence.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary aspect of the fighting
up to our arrival at Gyantse was that we had only
one casualty from a gunshot wound&mdash;the Sikh
who was shot in the hand at the Dzama Tang
affair by a Tibetan whose jezail was almost touching
him. Yet at the Hot Springs the Tibetans
fired off their matchlocks and rifles into the thick
of us, and at Guru an hour afterwards the Gurkhas
walked right up to a house held by the enemy,
under heavy fire, and took it without a casualty.
The mounted infantry were exposed to a volley
at Samando at 100 yards, and again in the Red
Idol Gorge they rode through the enemy's fire
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
at an even shorter range. In the same action
the 32nd made a frontal attack on a strong position
which was held until they were within eighty
yards, and not a man was hit. No wonder we had
a contempt for the Tibetan arms. Their matchlocks,
weapons of the rudest description, must
have been as dangerous to their own marksmen
as to the enemy; their artillery fire, to judge by
our one experience of it at Dzama Tang, was
harmless and erratic; and their modern Lhasa-made
rifles had not left a mark on our men. The
Tibetans' only chance seemed to be a rush at close
quarters, but they had not proved themselves
competent swordsmen. My own individual case
was sufficient to show that they were bunglers.
Besides the twelve wounds I received at the Hot
Springs, I found seven sword-cuts on my poshteen,
none of which were driven home. During the
whole campaign we had only one death from
sword-wounds.</p>

<p>Arrived at Gyantse, we settled down with some
sense of security. A bazaar was held outside the
camp. The people seemed friendly, and brought
in large quantities of supplies. Colonel Younghusband,
in a despatch to the Foreign Office, reported
that with the surrender of Gyantse Fort
on April 12 resistance in that part of Tibet was
ended. A letter was received from the Amban
stating that he would certainly reach Gyantse
within the next three weeks, and that competent
and trustworthy Tibetan representatives would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
accompany him. The Lhasa officials, it was said,
were in a state of panic, and had begged the
Amban to visit the British camp and effect a
settlement.</p>

<p>On April 20 General Macdonald's staff, with the
10-pounder guns, three companies of the 23rd
Pioneers, and one and a half companies of the
8th Gurkhas, returned to Chumbi to relieve the
strain on the transport and strengthen the line of
communications. Gyantse Jong was evacuated,
and we occupied a position in a group of houses,
as we thought, well out of range of fire from the
fort.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet until the end of April,
when we heard that the Tibetans were occupying
a wall in some strength near the Karo la, forty-two
miles from Gyantse, on the road to Lhasa.
Colonel Brander, of the 32nd Pioneers, who was
left in command at Gyantse, sent a small party
of mounted infantry and pioneers to reconnoitre
the position. They discovered 2,000 of the enemy
behind a strong loopholed wall stretching across
the valley, a distance of nearly 600 yards. As the
party explored the ravine they had a narrow escape
from a booby-trap, a formidable device of Tibetan
warfare, which was only employed against our
troops on this occasion. An artificial avalanche
of rocks and stones is so cunningly contrived
that the removal of one stone sends the whole
engine of destruction thundering down the hillside.
Luckily, the Tibetans did not wait for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
our main body, but loosed the machine on an
advance guard of mounted infantry, who were
in extended order and able to take shelter behind
rocks.</p>

<p>On the return of the reconnaissance Colonel
Brander decided to attack, as he considered the
gathering threatened the safety of the mission.
The Karo Pass is an important strategical position,
lying as it does at the junction of the two
roads to India, one of which leads to Kangma,
the other to Gyantse. A strong force holding the
pass might at any moment pour troops down the
valley to Kangma, cut us off in the rear, and
destroy our line of communications. When Colonel
Brander led his small force to take the pass, it
was not with the object of clearing the road to
Lhasa. The measure was purely defensive: the
action was undertaken to keep the road open
for convoys and reinforcements, and to protect
isolated posts on the line. The force with the
mission was still an 'escort,' and so far its operations
had been confined to dispersing the armed
levies that blocked the road.</p>

<p>On May 3 Colonel Brander left Gyantse with
his column of 400 rifles, comprising three companies
of the 32nd Pioneers, under Captains
Bethune and Cullen and Lieutenant Hodgson;
one company of the 8th, under Major Row
and Lieutenant Coleridge, with two 7-pounder
guns; the Maxim detachment of the Norfolks,
under Lieutenant Hadow; and forty-five of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
1st Mounted Infantry, under Captain Ottley. On
the first day the column marched eighteen miles,
and halted at Gobshi. On the second day they
reached Ralung, eleven miles further, and on the
third marched up the pass and encamped on an
open spot about two miles from where the Tibetans
had built their wall. A reconnaissance that afternoon
estimated the enemy at 2,000, and they
were holding the strongest position on the road to
Lhasa. They had built a wall the whole length
of a narrow spur and up the hill on the other side
of the stream, and in addition held detached
sangars high up the steep hills, and well thrown
forward. Their flanks rested on very high and
nearly precipitous rocks. It was only possible to
climb the ridge on our right from a mile behind,
and on the left from nearly three-quarters of a
mile. Colonel Brander at first considered the
practicability of delaying the attack on the main
wall until the Gurkhas had completed their flanking
movements, cleared the Tibetans out of the
sangars that enfiladed our advance in the valley,
and reached a position on the hills beyond the
wall, whence they could fire into the enemy's
rear. But the cliffs were so sheer that the ascent
was deemed impracticable, and the next morning
it was decided to make a frontal attack without
waiting for the Gurkhas to turn the flank. No
one for a moment thought it could be done.</p>

<p>The troops marched out of camp at ten o'clock.
One company of the 32nd Pioneers, under Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Cullen, was detailed to attack on the right, and
a second company, under Captain Bethune, to
follow the river-bed, where they were under cover
of the high bank until within 400 yards of the
wall, and then rush the centre of the position.
The 1st Mounted Infantry, under Captain Ottley,
were to follow this company along the valley.
The guns, Maxims, and one company of the 32nd
in reserve, occupied a small plateau in the centre.
Half a company of the 8th Gurkhas were left
behind to guard the camp. A second half-company,
under Major Row, were sent along the hillside
on the left to attack the enemy's extreme
right sangar, but their progress over the shifting
shale slopes and jagged rocks was so slow that the
front attack did not wait for them.</p>

<p>The fire from the wall was very heavy, and the
advance of Cullen's and Bethune's companies was
checked. Bethune sent half a company back,
and signalled to the mounted infantry to retire.
Then, compelled by some fatal impulse, he changed
his mind, and with half a company left the cover
of the river-bed and rushed out into the open
within forty yards of the main wall, exposed to a
withering fire from three sides. His half-company
held back, and Bethune fell shot through
the head with only four men by his side&mdash;a bugler,
a store-office babu, and two devoted Sikhs. What
the clerk was doing there no one knows, but
evidently the soldier in the man had smouldered in
suppression among the office files and triumphed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
splendidly. It was a gallant reckless charge
against uncounted odds. Poor Bethune had
learnt to despise the Tibetans' fire, and his contempt
was not unnatural. On the march to
Gyantse the enemy might have been firing blank
cartridges for all the effect they had left on our
men. At Dzama Tang Bethune had made a
frontal attack on a strong position, and carried it
without losing a man. Against a similar rabble
it might have been possible to rush the wall with
his handful of Sikhs, but these new Kham levies
who held the Karo la were a very different type
of soldier.</p>

<p>The frontal attack was a terrible mistake, as
was shown four hours afterwards, when the
enemy were driven from their position without
further loss to ourselves by a flanking movement
on the right.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock Major Row, after a laborious
climb, reached a point on a hillside level with the
sangars, which were strongly held on a narrow
ledge 200 yards in front of him. Here he sent up
a section of his men under cover of projecting
rocks to get above the sangars and fire down into
them. In the meanwhile some of the enemy
scrambled on to the rocks above, and began throwing
down boulders at the Gurkhas, but these
either broke up or fell harmless on the shale slopes
above. After waiting an hour, Major Row went
back himself and found his section checked half-way
by the stone-throwing and shots from above;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
they had tried another way, but found it impracticable.</p>

<p>Keeping a few men back to fire on any stone-throwers
who showed themselves, Row dribbled
his men across the difficult place, and in half
an hour reached the rocky ledge above the
sangars and looked right down on the enemy.
At the first few shots from the Gurkhas they
began to bolt, and, coming into the fire of the
men below, who now rushed forward, nearly
every man&mdash;forty in all&mdash;was killed. One or two
who escaped the fire found their flight cut off by
a precipice, and in an abandonment of terror
hurled themselves down on the rocks below.
After clearing the sangar, the Gurkhas had only
to surmount the natural difficulties of the rocky
and steep hill; for though the enemy fired on
them from the wall, their shooting was most
erratic. When at last they reached a small spur
that overlooked the Tibetan main position, they
found, to their disgust, that each man was protected
from their fire by a high stone traverse,
on the right-hand of which he lay secure, and
fired through loopholes barely a foot from the
ground.</p>

<p>The Gurkhas had accomplished a most difficult
mountaineering feat under a heavy fire; they
had turned the enemy out of their sangars, and
after four hours' climbing they had scaled the
heights everyone thought inaccessible. But their
further progress was barred by a sheer cliff; they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
had reached a cul-de-sac. Looking up from the
valley, it appeared that the spot where they
stood commanded the enemy's position, but we
had not reckoned on the traverses. This amazing
advance in the enemy's defensive tactics had
rendered their position unassailable from the
left, and made the Gurkhas' flanking movement
a splendid failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fp142"></a><a href="images/fp142.jpg">
<img src="images/fp142s.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />Pioneers destroying Kangma Wall.</span>
</div>

<p>It was now two o'clock, and, except for the capture
of the enemy's right sangars, we had done
nothing to weaken their opposition. The frontal
and flanking attacks had failed. Bethune was
killed, and seventeen men. Our guns had made
no impression on their wall. Looking down from
the spur which overlooked the Tibetan camp and
the valley beyond, the Gurkhas could see a large
reinforcement of at least 500 men coming up to
join the enemy. The situation was critical. In
four hours we had done nothing, and we knew
that if we could not take the place by dusk we
would have to abandon the attack or attempt to
rush the camp at night. That would have been a
desperate undertaking&mdash;400 men against 3,000, a
rush at close quarters with the bayonet, in which
the superiority of our modern rifles would be
greatly discounted.</p>

<p>Matters were at this crisis, when we saw the
Tibetans running out of their extreme left sangars.
At twelve o'clock, when the front attack had
failed and the left attack was apparently making
no progress, fifteen men of the 32nd who were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
held in reserve were sent up the hill on the right.
They had reached a point above the enemy's left
forward sangar, and were firing into it with great
effect. Twice the Tibetans rushed out, and, coming
under a heavy Maxim fire, bolted back again.
The third time they fled in a mass, and the
Maxims mowed down about thirty. The capture
of the sangars was a signal for a general
stampede. From the position they had won the
Sikhs could enfilade the main wall itself. The
Tibetans only waited a few shots; then they
turned and fled in three huge bodies down the
valley. Thus the fifteen Sikhs on the right saved
the situation. The tension had been great. In
no other action during the campaign, if we except
Palla, did the success of our arms stand so long in
doubt. Had we failed to take the wall by daylight,
Colonel Brander's column would have been
in a most precarious position. We could not
afford to retire, and a night attack could only
have been pushed home with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Directly the flight began, the 1st Mounted Infantry&mdash;forty-two
men, under Captain Ottley&mdash;rode
up to the wall. They were ten minutes
making a breach. Then they poured into the
valley and harassed the flying masses, riding on
their flanks and pursuing them for ten miles to
within sight of the Yamdok Tso. It showed
extraordinary courage on the part of this little
band of Masbis and Gurkhas that they did not
hesitate to hurl themselves on the flanks of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
enormous body of men, like terriers on the heels
of a flock of cattle, though they had had experience
of their stubborn resistance the whole day
long, and rode through the bodies of their fallen
comrades. Not a man drew rein. The Tibetans
were caught in a trap. The hills that sloped
down to the valley afforded them little cover.
Their fate was only a question of time and ammunition.
The mounted infantry returned at
night with only three casualties, having killed
over 300 men.</p>

<p>The sortie to the Karo la was one of the most
brilliant episodes of the campaign. We risked
more then than on any other occasion. But the
safety of the mission and many isolated posts on
the line was imperilled by this large force at the
cross-roads, which might have increased until it
had doubled or trebled if we had not gone out
to disperse it. A weak commander might have
faltered and weighed the odds, but Colonel
Brander saw that it was a moment to strike, and
struck home. His action was criticised at the
time as too adventurous. But the sortie is one
of the many instances that our interests are best
cared for by men who are beyond the telegraph-poles,
and can act on their own initiative without
reference to Government offices in Simla.</p>

<p>As the column advanced to the Karo la, a
message was received that the mission camp at
Gyantse had been attacked in the early morning
of the 5th, and that Major Murray's men&mdash;150
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
odd rifles&mdash;had not only beaten the enemy off,
but had made three sorties from different points
and killed 200.</p>

<p>With the action at the Karo la and the attack
on the mission at Gyantse began the second phase
of the operations, during which we were practically
besieged in our own camp, and for nine
weeks compelled to act on the defensive. The
courage of the Tibetans was now proved beyond
a doubt. The new levies from Kham and Shigatze
were composed of very different men from
those we herded like sheep at Guru. They were
also better armed than our previous assailants, and
many of them knew how to shoot. At the same
time they were better led. The primitive ideas
of strategy hitherto displayed by the Tibetans
gave place to more advanced tactics. The usual
story got wind that the Tibetans were being led
by trained Russian Buriats. But there was no
truth in it. The altered conditions of the campaign,
as we may call it, after it became necessary
to begin active operations, were due to the force
of circumstances&mdash;the arrival of stouter levies
from the east, the great numerical superiority of
the enemy, and their strongly fortified positions.</p>

<p>The operations at Gyantse are fully dealt with
in another chapter, and I will conclude this account
of the opposition to our advance with a description
of the attack on the Kangma post, the only
attempt on the part of the enemy to cut off
our line of communications. Its complete failure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
seems to have deterred the Tibetans from subsequent
ventures of the kind.</p>

<p>From Ralung, ten miles this side of the Karo la,
two roads branch off to India. The road leading
to Kangma is the shortest route; the other road
makes a d√©tour of thirty miles to include Gyantse.
Ralung lies at the apex of the triangle, as shown
in this rough diagram. Gyantse and Kangma
form the two base angles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/p146.png"><img src="images/p146s.png" alt="Diagram." title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>If it had been possible, a strong post would have
been left at the Karo la after the action of May 6.
But our small force was barely sufficient to garrison
Gyantse, and we had to leave the alternative
approach to Kangma unguarded. An attack was
expected there; the post was strongly fortified,
and garrisoned by two companies of the 23rd
Pioneers, under Captain Pearson.</p>

<p>The attack, which was made on June 7, was
unexpectedly dramatic. We have learnt that the
Tibetan has courage, but in other respects he is
still an unknown quantity. In motive and action
he is as mysterious and unaccountable as his
paradoxical associations would lead us to imagine.
In dealing with the Tibetans one must expect
the unexpected. They will try to achieve the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
impossible, and shut their eyes to the obvious.
They have a genius for doing the wrong thing at
the wrong time. Their √©lan, their dogged courage,
their undoubted heroism, their occasional acuteness,
their more general imbecile folly and vacillation
and inability to grasp a situation, make it
impossible to say what they will do in any given
circumstances. A few dozen men will hurl themselves
against hopeless odds, and die to a man
fighting desperately; a handful of impressed
peasants will devote themselves to death in the
defence of a village, like the old Roman patriots.
At other times they will forsake a strongly
sangared position at the first shot, and thousands
will prowl round a camp at night, shouting grotesquely,
but too timid to make a determined
attack on a vastly outnumbered enemy.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the enemy may be accounted
for to some extent by the fact that we are not
often opposed by the same levies, which would
imply that theirs is greatly the courage of ignorance.
Yet in the face of the fighting at Palla,
Naini, and Gyantse Jong, this is evidently no
fair estimate of the Tibetan spirit. The men who
stood in the breach at Gyantse in that hell of
shrapnel and Maxim and rifle fire, and dropped
down stones on our Gurkhas as they climbed the
wall, met death knowingly, and were unterrified
by the resources of modern science in war, the
magic, the demons, the unseen, unimagined messengers
of death.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>But the men who attacked the Kangma post,
what parallel in history have we for these? They
came by night many miles over steep mountain
cliffs and rocky ravines, perhaps silently, with
determined purpose, weighing the odds; or, as
I like to think, boastfully, with song and jest,
saying, 'We will steal in upon these English at
dawn before they wake, and slay them in their
beds. Then we will hold the fort, and kill all
who come near.'</p>

<p>They came in the gray before dawn, and hid
in a gully beside our camp. At five the reveill√©
sounded and the sentry left the bastions. Then
they sprang up and rushed, sword in hand, their
rifles slung behind their backs, to the wall. The
whole attack was directed on the south-east front,
an unscalable wall of solid masonry, with bastions
at each corner four feet thick and ten feet high.
They directed their attack on the bastions, the
only point on that side they could scramble over.
They knew nothing of the fort and its tracing.
Perhaps they had expected to find us encamped
in tents on the open ground. But from the shallow
nullah where they lay concealed, not 200 yards
distant, and watched our sentry, they could survey
the uncompromising front which they had
set themselves to attack with the naked sword.
They had no artillery or guncotton or materials
for a siege, but they hoped to scale the wall and
annihilate the garrison that held it. They had
come from Lhasa to take Kangma, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
were not going to turn back. They came on undismayed,
like men flushed with victory. The
sepoys said they must be drunk or drugged. They
rushed to the bottom of the wall, tore out stones,
and flung them up at our sepoys; they leapt up
to seize the muzzles of our rifles, and scrambled
to gain a foothold and lift themselves on to the
parapet; they fell bullet-pierced, and some turned
savagely on the wall again. It was only a question
of time, of minutes, and the cool mechanical
fire of the 23rd Pioneers would have dropped every
man. One hundred and six bodies were left under
the wall, and sixty more were killed in the pursuit.
Never was there such a hopeless, helpless struggle,
such desperate and ineffectual gallantry.</p>

<p>Almost before it was light the yak corps with
their small escort of thirty rifles of the 2nd
Gurkhas were starting on the road to Kalatso.
They had passed the hiding-place of the Tibetans
without noticing the 500 men in rusty-coloured
cloaks breathing quietly among the brown stones.
Then the Tibetans made their charge, just as the
transport had passed, and a party of them made
for the yaks. Two Tibetan drivers in our service
stood directly in their path. 'Who are you?'
cried one of the enemy. 'Only yak-drivers,' was
the frightened answer. 'Then, take that,' the
Tibetan said, slashing at his arm with no intent
to kill. The Gurkha escort took up a position
behind a sangar and opened fire&mdash;all save one
man, who stood by his yak and refused to come
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
under cover, despite the shouts and warnings of
his comrades. He killed several, but fell himself,
hacked to pieces with swords. The Tibetans
were driven off, and joined the rout from the
fort. The whole affair lasted less than ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Our casualties were: the isolated Gurkha killed,
two men in the fort wounded by stones, and three
of the 2nd Gurkhas severely wounded&mdash;two by
sword-cuts, one by a bullet in the neck.</p>

<p>But what was the flame that smouldered in
these men and lighted them to action? They
might have been Paladins or Crusaders. But the
Buddhists are not fanatics. They do not stake
eternity on a single existence. They have no
Mahdis or Juggernaut cars. The Tibetans, we
are told, are not patriots. Politicians say that
they want us in their country, that they are priest-ridden,
and hate and fear their Lamas. What,
then, drove them on? It was certainly not fear.
No people on earth have shown a greater contempt
for death. Their Lamas were with them until the
final assault. Twenty shaven polls were found
hiding in the nullah down which the Tibetans had
crept in the dark, and were immediately despatched.
What promises and cajoleries and
threats the holy men used no one will ever know.
But whatever the alternative, their simple followers
preferred death.</p>

<p>The second phase of the operations, in which we
had to act on the defensive in Gyantse, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
beginning of the third phase, which saw the arrival
of reinforcements and the collapse of the Tibetan
opposition, are described by an eye-witness in the
next two chapters. During the whole of these
operations I was invalided in Darjeeling, owing to
a second operation which had to be performed on
my amputation wound.</p>

<small>GYANTSE</small></h2>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">By Henry Newman</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gyantse Plain</span> lies at the intersection of four
great valleys running almost at right angles to
one another. In the north-eastern corner there
emerge two gigantic ridges of sandstone. On one
is built the jong, and on the other the monastery.
The town fringes the base of the jong, and creeps
into the hollow between the two ridges. The
plain, about six miles by ten, is cultivated almost
to the last inch, if we except a few stony patches
here and there. There are, I believe, thirty-three
villages in the plain. These are built in the midst
of groves of poplar and willow. At one time, no
doubt, the waters from the four valleys united to
form a lake. Now they have found an outlet,
and flow peacefully down Shigatze way. High up
on the cold mountains one sees the cold bleached
walls of the Seven Monasteries, some of them
perched on almost inaccessible cliffs, whence they
look sternly down on the warmth and prosperity
below.</p>

<p>For centuries the Gyantse folk had lived self-contained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and happy, practising their simple arts
of agriculture, and but dimly aware of any world
outside their own. Then one day there marched
into their midst a column of British troops&mdash;white-faced
Englishmen, dark, lithe Gurkhas, great,
solemn, bearded Sikhs&mdash;and it was borne in upon
the wondering Gyantse men that beyond their
frontiers there existed great nations&mdash;so great,
indeed, that they ventured to dispute on equal
terms with the awful personage who ruled from
Lhasa. It is true that from time to time there
must have passed through Gyantse rumours of
war on the distant frontier. The armies that we
defeated at Guru and in the Red Idol Gorge had
camped at Gyantse on their way to and fro.
Gyantse saw and wondered at the haste of Lhasa
despatch-riders. But I question whether any
Gyantse man realized that events, great and
shattering in his world, were impending when
the British column rounded the corner of Naini
Valley.</p>

<p>At first we were received without hostility, or
even suspicion. The ruined jong, uninhabited
save for a few droning Lamas, was surrendered
as soon as we asked for it. A clump of buildings
in a large grove near the river was rented
without demur&mdash;though at a price&mdash;to the Commission.
And when the country-people found
that there was a sale for their produce, they
flocked to the camp to sell. The entry of the
British troops made no difference to the peace
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of Gyantse till the Lamas of Lhasa embarked
on the fatal policy of levying more troops in
Lhasa, Shigatze, and far-away Kham, and sending
them down to fight. Then there entered the
peaceful valley all the horrors of war&mdash;dead and
maimed men in the streets and houses, burning
villages, death and destruction of all kinds.
Gyantse Plain and the town became scenes of
desolation. To the British army in India war,
unfortunately, is nothing new, but one can
imagine what an upheaval this business of
which I am about to write meant to people who
for generations had lived in peace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/fp154s.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />Gyantse Jong.</span>
</div>

<p>The incidents connected with the arrival of the
mission with its escort at Gyantse need not be
described in detail. On the day of arrival we
camped in the midst of some fallow fields about
two miles from the jong. The same afternoon a
Chinese official, who called himself 'General' Ma,
came into camp with the news that the jong was
unoccupied, and that the local Tibetans did not
propose to offer any resistance. The next morning
we took quiet possession of the jong, placing
two companies of Pioneers in garrison. The
General with a small escort visited the monastery
behind the fort, and was received with friendliness
by the venerable Abbot. Neither the villagers nor
the towns-people showed any signs of resentment
at our presence. The Jongpen actively interested
himself in the question of procuring an official residence
for Colonel Younghusband and the members
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of the mission. There were reports of the Dalai
Lama's representatives coming in haste to treat.
Altogether the outlook was so promising that
nobody was surprised when, after a stay of a
week, General Macdonald, bearing in mind the
difficulty of procuring supplies for the whole force,
announced his intention of returning to Chumbi
with the larger portion of the escort, leaving a
sufficient guard with the mission.</p>

<p>The guard left behind consisted of four
companies of the 32nd Pioneers, under Colonel
Brander; four companies of the 8th Gurkhas,
under Major Row; the 1st Mounted Infantry,
under Captain Ottley; and the machine-gun
section of the Norfolks, under Lieutenant Hadow.
Mention should also be made of the two 7-pounder
mountain-guns attached to the 8th Gurkhas,
under the command of Captain Luke.</p>

<p>Before the General left for Chumbi he decided
to evacuate the jong. The grounds on which
this decision was come to were that the whole
place was in a ruinous and dangerous condition,
the surroundings were insanitary, there was only
one building fit for human habitation, the water-supply
was bad and deficient, and there seemed
to be no prospect of further hostilities. Besides,
from the military point of view there was some
risk in splitting up the small guard to be left
behind between the jong and the mission post.
However, the precaution was taken of further
dismantling the jong. The gateways and such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
portions as seemed capable of lending themselves
to defence were blown up.</p>

<p>The house, or, rather, group of houses, rented
by Colonel Younghusband for the mission was
situated about 100 yards from a well-made stone
bridge over the river. A beautiful grove, mostly
of willow, extended behind the post along the
banks of the river to a distance of about 500 yards.
The jong lay about 1,800 yards to the right front.
There were two houses in the intervening space,
built amongst fields of iris and barley. Small
groups of trees were dotted here and there. Altogether,
the post was located in a spot as pleasant
as one could hope to find in Tibet.</p>

<p>For some days before the General left, all the
troops were engaged in putting the post in a
state of defence. It was found that the force
to be left behind could be easily located within
the perimeter of a wall built round the group
of houses. There was no room, however, for
200 mules and their drivers, needed for convoy
purposes. These were placed in a kind of hornwork
thrown out to the right front.</p>

<p>After the departure of the General we resigned
ourselves to what we conceived would be a monotonous
stay at Gyantse of two or three months,
pending the signing of the treaty. The people
continued to be perfectly friendly. A market was
established outside the post, to which practically
the whole bazaar from Gyantse town was removed.
We were able to buy in the market, very cheap,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the famous Gyantse carpets, for which enormous
prices are demanded at Darjeeling and elsewhere
in India. Unarmed officers wandered freely about
Gyantse town, and the monks of Palkhor Choide,
the monastery behind the fort, willingly conducted
parties over the most sacred spots. They even
readily sold some of the images before the altars,
and the silk screens which shrouded the forms
of the gigantic Buddhas. I mention these facts
about the carpets and images because, when hereafter
they adorned Simla and Darjeeling drawing-rooms,
unkind people began to say that British
officers had wantonly looted Palkhor Choide, one
of the most famous monasteries in Tibet.</p>

<p>A little shooting was to be had, and officers
wandered about the plain, gun in hand, bringing
home mountain-hare&mdash;a queer little beast with a
blue rump&mdash;duck, and pigeon. Occasionally an
excursion up one of the side valleys would result
in the shooting of a burhel or of a Tibetan gazelle.
The country-people met with were all perfectly
friendly.</p>

<p>Another feature of those first few peaceful days
at Gyantse was the eagerness with which the
Tibetans availed themselves of the skilled medical
attendance with the mission. At first only one
or two men wounded at the Red Idol Gorge were
brought in, but the skill of Captain Walton, Indian
Medical Service, soon began to be noised abroad,
and every morning the little outdoor dispensary
was crowded with sufferers of all kinds.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>But during the last week in May reports began
to reach Colonel Younghusband that, so far from
attempting to enter into negociations, the Lhasa
Government was levying an army in Kham, and
that already five or six hundred men were camped
on the other side of the Karo la, and were busily
engaged in building a wall. Lieutenant Hodgson
with a small force was sent to reconnoitre. He
came back with the news that the wall was already
built, stretching from one side of the valley to the
other, and that there were several thousand well-armed
men behind it. Both Colonel Younghusband
and Colonel Brander considered it highly
necessary that this gathering should be immediately
dispersed, for it is a principle in Indian
frontier warfare to strike quickly at any tribal
assembly, in order to prevent it growing into
dangerous proportions. The possibly exciting
effect the force on the Karo la might have on the
inhabitants of Gyantse had particularly to be considered.
Accordingly, on May 3 Colonel Brander
led the major portion of the Gyantse garrison
towards the Karo la, leaving behind as a guard to
the post two companies of Gurkhas, a company
of the 32nd Pioneers, and a few mounted infantry,
all under the command of Major Murray.</p>

<p>I accompanied the Karo la column, and must
rely on hearsay as to my facts with regard to the
attack on the mission. We heard about the
attack the night before Colonel Brander drove
the Tibetans from their wall on the Karo la, after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
a long fight which altered all our previous conceptions
of the fighting qualities of the Tibetans.
The courage shown by the enemy naturally
excited apprehension about the safety of the
mission. Colonel Brander did not stay to rest
his troops after their day of arduous fighting, but
began his return march next morning, arriving at
Gyantse on the 9th.</p>

<p>The column had been warned that it was likely
to be fired on from the jong if it entered camp by
the direct Lhasa road. Accordingly, we marched
in by a circuitous route, moving in under cover
of the grove previously mentioned. The Maxims
and guns came into action at the edge of the
grove to cover the baggage. But, though numbers
of Tibetans were seen on the walls of the jong,
not a shot was fired.</p>

<p>We then learnt the story of the attack on the
post. It appears that the day after Colonel
Brander left for the Karo la (May 3) certain
wounded and sick Tibetans that we had been
attending informed the mission that about 1,000
armed men had come down towards Gyantse
from Shigatze, and were building a wall about
twelve miles away. It was added that they might
possibly attack the post if they got to know that
the garrison had been largely depleted. This
news seemed to be worth inquiring into, and,
accordingly, next day Major Murray sent some
mounted infantry to reconnoitre up the Shigatze
road. The latter returned with the information
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that they had gone up the valley some seven or
eight miles, but had found no signs of any enemy.</p>

<p>The very next morning the post was attacked
at dawn. It appears that the Shigatze force,
about 1,000 strong, was really engaged in building
a wall twelve miles away. Hearing that very
few troops were guarding the mission, its commander&mdash;who,
I hear, was none other than
Khomba Bombu, the very man who arrested
Sven Hedin's dash to Lhasa&mdash;determined to
make a sudden attack on the post. He marched
his men during the night, and about an hour
before sunrise had them crouching behind trees
and inside ditches all round the post.</p>

<p>The attack was sudden and simultaneous. A
Gurkha sentry had just time to fire off his rifle
before the Tibetans rushed to our walls and had
their muskets through our loopholes. The enemy
did not for the moment attempt to scale, but contented
themselves with firing into the post through
the loopholes they had taken. This delay proved
fatal to their plans, for it gave the small garrison
time to rise and arm. The brunt of the Tibetan
fire was directed on the courtyard of the house
where the tents of the members of the mission
were pitched. Major Murray, who had rushed
out of bed half clad, first directed his attention
to this spot. The Sikhs, emerging from their
tents with bandolier and rifle, in extraordinary
costumes, were directed towards the loopholes.
Some were sent on the roof of the mission-house,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
whence they could enfilade the attackers. Elsewhere
various junior officers had taken command.
Captain Luke, who, owing to sickness, had not
gone on with the Karo la column, took charge of
the Gurkhas on the south and west fronts. Lieutenant
Franklin, the medical officer of the 8th
Gurkhas, rallied Gurkhas and Pioneers to the
loopholes on the east and north. Lieutenant
Lynch, the treasure-chest officer, who had a guard
of about twenty Gurkhas, took his men to the
main gate to the south. There were at this time
in hospital about a dozen Sikhs, who had been
badly burnt in a lamentable gunpowder explosion
a few days previously. These men, bandaged
and crippled as they were, rose from their couches,
made their painful way to the tops of the houses,
and fired into the enemy below. About a dozen
Tibetans had just begun to scramble over the
wall by the time the defenders had manned the
whole position, which was now not only held by
fighting men, but by various members of the
mission, including Colonel Younghusband, who
had emerged with revolvers and sporting guns.
A few of the enemy got inside the defences, and
were immediately shot down.</p>

<p>Our fire was so heavy and so well directed that
it is supposed that not more than ten minutes
elapsed from the time the first shot was fired
to the time the enemy began to withdraw. The
withdrawal, however, was only to the shelter of
trees and ditches a few hundred yards away,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
whence a long but almost harmless fusillade was
kept up on the post. After about twenty minutes
of this firing, Major Murray determined on a rally.
Lieutenant Lynch with his treasure guard dashed
out from the south gate. Some five-and-twenty
Tibetans were discovered hiding in a small refuse
hut about fifteen yards from the gate. The
furious Gurkhas rushed in upon them and killed
them all, and then dashed on through the long
grove, clearing the enemy in front of them. Returning
along the banks of the river, the same
party discovered another body of Tibetans hiding
under the arches of the bridge. Twenty or thirty
were shot down, and about fifteen made prisoners.
Similar success attended a rally from the north-east
gate made by Major Murray and Lieutenant
Franklin. The enemy fled howling from their
hiding-places towards the town and jong as soon
as they saw our men issue. They were pursued
almost to the very walls of the fort. Indeed, but
for the fringe of houses and narrow streets at the
base of the jong, Major Murray would have gone
on. The Tibetans, however, turned as soon as
they reached the shelter of walls, and it would
have been madness to attack five or six hundred
determined men in a maze of alleys and passages
with only a weak company. Major Murray accordingly
made his way back to the post, picking
up a dozen prisoners <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>In this affair our casualties only amounted to
five wounded and two killed. One hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
forty dead of the enemy were counted outside the
camp.</p>

<p>During the course of the day Major Murray sent
a flag of truce to the jong with an intimation to
the effect that the Tibetans could come out and
bury their dead without fear of molestation. The
reply was that we could bury the dead ourselves
without fear of molestation. As it was impossible
to leave all the bodies in the vicinity of the camp,
a heavy and disagreeable task was thrown on the
garrison.</p>

<p>Towards sundown the enemy in the jong began
to fire into the camp, and our troops became
aware of the unpleasant fact that the Tibetans
possessed jingals, which could easily range from
1,800 to 2,000 yards. It was also realized that
the jong entirely dominated the post; that our
walls and stockades, protection enough against
a direct assault from the plain, were no protection
against bullets dropped from a height.
So for the next four days, pending the return of
the Karo la column, the little garrison toiled unceasingly
at improving the defences. Traverses
were built, the walls raised in height, the
gates strengthened. It was discovered that the
Tibetan fire was heaviest when we attempted to
return it by sniping at figures seen on the jong.
Accordingly, pending the completion of the traverses
and other new protective works, Major
Murray forbade any return fire.</p>

<p>Such was the position of affairs when the Karo la
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
column returned. One of Colonel Brander's first
acts, after his weary troops had rested for an hour
or two, was to turn the Maxim on the groups who
could be seen wandering about the jong. They
quickly disappeared under cover, but only to man
their jingals. Then began the bombardment of
the post, which we had to endure for nearly seven
weeks.</p>

<p>This is the place to speak of the bombardment
generally, for it would be tedious to recapitulate
in the form of a diary incidents which, however
exciting at the time, now seem remarkable only
for their monotony. It may be said at once that
the bombardment was singularly ineffective.
From first to last only fifteen men in the post
were hit. Of these twelve were either killed or
died of the wound. Of course, I exclude the
casualties in the fighting, of which I will presently
speak, outside the post. But the futility of the
bombardment must not be entirely put down to
bad marksmanship on the part of the Tibetans.
That our losses were not heavier is largely due to
the fact that the garrison laboured daily&mdash;and at
first at night also&mdash;in erecting protecting walls
and traverses. Practically every tent had a
traverse built in front of it. It was found that
the hornwork in which the mules were located
came particularly under fire of the jong. This
was pulled down one dark night, and the mules
transferred to a fresh enclosure at the back of the
post. Strong parapets of sand-bags were built on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the roofs of the houses. Every window facing the
jong was securely blocked with mud bricks. It
will be realized how considerable was the labour
involved in building the traverses when it is
remembered that the jong looked down into the
post. The majority of the walls had to be considerably
higher than the tents themselves. They
were mostly built of stakes cut from the grove,
with two feet of earth rammed in between. After
the first week or so the enemy brought to bear on
the post several brass cannon, throwing balls
weighing four or five pounds, and travelling with
a velocity which enabled them to penetrate our
traverses&mdash;when they struck them, for the majority
of shots from the cannon whistled harmlessly over
our heads.</p>

<p>Practically, we did not return the fire from the
jong. All that was done in this direction was to
place one of Lieutenant Hadow's Maxims on the
roof of the house occupied by the mission, and
thence to snipe during the daylight hours at any
warriors who showed themselves above the walls
of the jong. Hadow was very patient and persistent
with his gun, and quickly made it clear to
the Tibetans that, if we were obliged to keep under
cover, so were they. But our fire from the post
was probably as ineffective as that of the enemy
from the jong, for the Tibetans build walls with
extraordinary rapidity. Working mostly at night
in order to avoid the malignant Maxim, the enemy
within a few days almost altered the face of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
jong. New walls, traverses, and covered ways
seemed to spring up with the rapidity of mushrooms.</p>

<p>Our life during the siege, if so the bombardment
can be called, was hardly as unpleasant as people
might imagine. To begin with, we were never
short of food&mdash;that is to say, of Tibetan barley
and meat. The commissariat stock of tea&mdash;a
necessity in Tibet&mdash;also never gave out. From
time to time also convoys and parcel-posts with
little luxuries came through. Again, the longest
period for which we were without a letter-post
was eight days. Socially, the relations of the
officers with one another and with the members
of the Commission were most harmonious. I make
a point of mentioning this fact, because all those
who have had any experience of sieges, or of
similar conditions where small communities are
shut up together in circumstances of hardship and
danger, know how apt the temper is to get on
edge, how often small differences are likely to give
rise to bitter animosities. But we had in the
Gyantse garrison men of such vast experience and
geniality as Colonel Brander, of such high culture
and attainment as Colonel Younghusband, Captain
O'Connor, and Mr. Perceval Landon&mdash;the correspondent
of <i>The Times</i>; men whose spirits never
failed, and who found humour in everything, such
as Major Row, Captain Luke, Captain Coleridge,
Lieutenant Franklin. Amongst the besieged
was Colonel Waddell, I.M.S., an Orientalist and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Sinologist of European fame. Hence, in some
of its aspects the Gyantse siege was almost a
delightful episode. In the later days, when all
the outpost fighting occurred, our spirits were
somewhat damped, for we had to mourn brave
men killed and sympathize with others dangerously
wounded.</p>

<p>Of course, one of the first questions for consideration
when the Karo la column returned to
Gyantse was whether the enemy could or could
not be turned out of the jong. To make a
frontal attack on the frowning face overlooking
the post would have been foolhardy, but Colonel
Brander decided to make a reconnaissance to a
monastery on the high hills to our right, whence
the jong itself could be overlooked. A subsidiary
reason for visiting this monastery was that it was
known to have afforded shelter to a number of
those who had fled from the attack on the post.
The hill was climbed with every military precaution,
but only a few old monks were found in
occupation of the buildings. More disappointing
was the fact that an examination through telescopes
of the rear of the jong showed that the
Tibetans had been also building indefatigably
there. A strong loopholed wall ran zigzagging up
the side of the rock. It was clear that nothing
could be done till the General returned from
Chumbi with more troops and guns.</p>

<p>For more than two weeks our rear remained
absolutely open. The post, carried by mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
infantry, came in and went out regularly. Two
large convoys reached us unopposed. The only
danger lay in the fact that people seen entering
or leaving the post came under a heavy fire from
the jong. To minimize risks, departures from the
post were always made before dawn.</p>

<p>During the two weeks streams of men could be
seen entering the jong from both the Shigatze and
Lhasa roads. Emboldened by numbers, and also
by our non-aggressive attitude, the enemy began
to cast about for means of taking the post. One
of the first steps taken by the Tibetan General in
pursuance of this policy was to occupy during the
night a small house surrounded by trees, lying to
our left front, almost midway between the jong
and the post. On the morning of the 18th bullets
from a new direction were whizzing in amongst
us, and partly enfilading our traverses. This was
not to be tolerated, and the same night arrangements
were made for the capture of the position.</p>

<p>Five companies stole out during the hours of
darkness and surrounded the house. The rush,
delivered at dawn, was left to the Gurkhas. But
the entrance was found blocked with stones, and
the enemy was thoroughly awake by the time the
Gurkhas were under the wall. Luckily, the loopholes
were not so constructed as to allow the
Tibetans to fire their jingals down upon our men,
who had only to bear the brunt of showers of
stones thrown upon them from the roof. The
shower was well directed enough to bruise a
good many Gurkhas. Three officers were struck
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;
Major Murray, Lieutenant Lynch, and Lieutenant
Franklin, I.M.S. Whilst the Gurkhas were
striving to effect an entrance, the Pioneer companies
deployed on the flanks came under
a heavy fire from the jong. We had three men
hit. One fell on a bit of very exposed ground,
and was gallantly dragged under cover by Colonel
Brander and Captain Minogue, Staff officer.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that the Gurkhas would
never get in without explosives. Accordingly, Lieutenant
Gurdon, 32nd Pioneers, was sent to join
them with a box of guncotton. Gurdon speedily
blew a hole through the wall, and the Gurkhas
dashed in yelling. The Tibetans on the roof could
easily at this time have jumped off and escaped
towards the jong. But they chose a braver part.
They slid down into the middle of the courtyard,
and, drawing their swords, awaited the Gurkha
onset. I must not describe the pitiful struggle
that followed. The Tibetans&mdash;about fifty in
number&mdash;herded themselves together as if to
meet a bayonet charge, but our troops, rushing
through the door, extended themselves along the
edges of the courtyard, and emptied their magazines
into the mob. Within a minute all the fifty
were either dead or mortally wounded.</p>

<p>The house was hereafter held by a company of
Gurkhas all through the bombardment, and proved
a great thorn in the side of the enemy; for the
Gurkhas often used to sally out at night and
ambuscade parties of men and convoys on the
Shigatze road.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a><span>CHAPTER X</span>

<small>GYANTSE&mdash;<i>continued</i></small></h2>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">By Henry Newman</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of the day on which the house
was taken we were provided with a new excitement&mdash;continuous
firing was heard to the rear of
the post about a mile away. Captain Ottley
galloped out with his mounted infantry, and
was only just in time to save a party of his men
who were coming up from Kangma with the
letter-bags. These Sikhs&mdash;eight in number&mdash;were
riding along the edge of the river, when they were
met by a fusillade from a number of the enemy
concealed amongst sedges on the opposite bank.
Before the Sikhs could take cover, one man was
killed, three wounded, and seven out of the eight
horses shot down. The remaining men showed
rare courage. They carried their wounded comrades
under cover of a ditch, untied and brought
to the same place the letter-bags, and then lay
down and returned the fire of the enemy. The
Tibetans, however, were beginning to creep round,
and the ammunition of the Sikhs was running low,
when Captain Ottley dashed up to the rescue.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Without waiting to consider how many of the
enemy might be hiding in the sedge, Ottley took
his twenty men splashing through the river.
Nearly 300 Tibetans bolted out in all directions
like rabbits from a cover. The mounted infantry,
shooting and smiting, chased them to the very
edge of the plain. On reaching hilly ground the
enemy, who must have lost about fifty of their
number, began to turn, having doubtless realized
that they were running before a handful of men.
At the same time shots were fired from villages,
previously thought unoccupied, on Ottley's left,
and a body of matchlock men were seen running
up to reinforce from a large village on the Lhasa
road. Under these conditions it would have been
madness to continue the fight, and Ottley cleverly
and skilfully withdrew without having lost a
single man. In the meanwhile a company of
Pioneers had brought in the men wounded in the
attack on the postal riders.</p>

<p>This affair was even more significant than the
occupation by the enemy of the position taken by
the Gurkhas in the early morning. It showed
that the Tibetan General had at last conceived a
plan for cutting off our line of communications.
This was a rude shock. It implied that the
enemy had received reinforcements which were to
be utilized for offensive warfare of the kind most
to be feared by an invader. We knew that so
long as our ammunition lasted there was absolutely
no danger of the post being captured.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
But an enemy on the lines would certainly cause
the greatest annoyance to, and might even cut
off, our convoys. As it would be very difficult
to get messages through, apprehensions as to
our safety would be excited in the outer world.
Further, General Macdonald's arrangements for
the relief of the mission would have to be considerably
modified if he were obliged to fight his
way through to us.</p>

<p>With the same prompt decision that marked his
action with regard to the gathering on the Karo la,
Colonel Brander determined on the very next day
to clear the villages found occupied by the mounted
infantry. As far as could be discovered, the
villages were five in number, all on the right bank
of the river, and occupying a position which could
be roughly outlined as an equilateral triangle.
Captain Ottley was sent round to the rear of the
villages to cut off the retreat of the enemy; Captain
Luke took his two mountain-guns, under cover of
the right bank of the river, to a position whence he
could support the infantry attack, if necessary, by
shell fire. Two companies of Pioneers with one
in reserve were sent forward to the attack.</p>

<p>The first objective was two villages forming the
base of the triangle of which I have spoken. The
troops advanced cautiously, widely extended, but
both villages were found deserted. They were set
on fire. Then Captain Hodgson with a company
went forward to the village forming the apex of
the triangle. He came under a flanking fire from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the villages on the left, and had one man severely
wounded. The houses in front seemed to be unoccupied,
and our right might have been swung
round to face this fire; but Colonel Brander was
determined to do the work thoroughly, and Hodgson
was directed to move on and burn the village
ahead of him before changing front. The troops
accordingly took no notice of the flanking fire,
and moved on till they were under the walls of
the two houses of which the village was composed.</p>

<p>Suddenly fire was opened on our soldiers from
the upper windows of the two houses. All the doors
were found blocked with bricks and stones. Two
Sikhs dropped, and for the moment it seemed as
if we would lose heavily. But Lieutenant Gurdon
with half a dozen men rushed up with a box of
explosives, and blew a breach in the wall. Two
of the party helping to lay the fuse were killed by
shots fired from a loophole a few feet above.
Captain Hodgson was the first man through the
breach. He was confronted by a swordsman, who
cut hard just as Hodgson fired his revolver. The
man fell dead, but Hodgson received a severe
wound on the wrist. But this was the only man
who stood after the explosion. About thirty
others in the village rushed to the roofs of the
houses, jumped off, and fled to the left. They
came, however, under a very heavy fire as they
were running away, and the majority dropped.</p>

<p>Preparations were now made for taking the remaining
village. This was protected by a high
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
loopholed embankment, which sheltered about
five or six hundred of the enemy. The Pioneers
had just extended, and were advancing, when
someone who happened to be looking at the jong
through his glasses suddenly uttered a loud exclamation.
Turning round, we all saw a dense
stream of men, several thousands in number,
forming up at the base of the rock, evidently
with the intention of rushing the mission post
whilst the majority of the garrison and the guns
were engaged elsewhere. Colonel Brander immediately
gave the order for the whole force to
retire into the post at the double. The withdrawal
was effected before the Tibetans made
their contemplated rush, but we all felt that it
was rather a narrow shave.</p>

<p>Troops were to have gone out again the next
day to clear the village we had left untaken,
but the mounted infantry reconnoitring in the
morning reported that the enemy had fled,
and that the lines of communication were again
clear.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day a large convoy and reinforcements
under Major Peterson, 32nd Pioneers,
came safely through. The additional troops included
a section of No. 7 (British) Mountain
Battery, under Captain Easton; one and a half
companies of Sappers and Miners, under Captain
Shepherd and Lieutenant Garstin; and another
company of the 32nd Pioneers. Major Peterson
reported that his convoy had come under a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
fire from the village and monastery of Naini.
This monastery lies about seven miles from
Gyantse in an opening of the valley just before
the road turns into Gyantse Plain. It holds
about 5,000 monks. When the column first
passed by it, the monks were extremely friendly,
bringing out presents of butter and eggs, and
readily selling flour and meat. The monastery
is surrounded by a wall thirty feet high, and at
least ten feet thick. The buildings inside are
also solidly built of stone. Altogether the position
was a very difficult one to tackle, but Colonel
Brander, following his usual policy, decided that
the enemy must be turned out of it at all costs.
Accordingly, on the 24th a column, which included
Captain Easton's two guns, marched out to Naini.
But the monastery and the group of buildings outside
it were found absolutely deserted. The walls
were far too heavy and strong to be destroyed by
a small force, which had to return before nightfall,
but Captain Shepherd blew up the four towers at
the corners and a portion of the hall in which the
Buddhas were enthroned.</p>

<p>The 27th provided a new excitement. About
1,000 yards to the right of the post stood what
was known as the Palla House, the residence of a
Tibetan nobleman of great wealth. The building
consisted of a large double-storied house, surrounded
by a series of smaller buildings, each
within a courtyard of its own. During the night
the Tibetans in the jong built a covered way
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
extending about half the distance between the
jong and Palla. In the morning the latter place
was seen to be swarming with men, busily occupied
in erecting defences, making loopholes, and generally
engaged in work of a menacing character.
The enemy could less be tolerated in Palla than
in the Gurkha outpost, for fire from the former
would have taken us absolutely in the flank, and
the garrison was not strong enough to provide the
labour necessary for building an entirely new
series of traverses.</p>

<p>That very night Colonel Brander detailed the
troops that were to take Palla by assault at
dawn. The storming-party was composed of
three companies of the 32nd under Major Peterson,
assisted by the Sappers and Miners with
explosives under Captain Shepherd. Our four
mountain-guns, the 7-pounders under Captain
Luke, and the 10-pounders under Captain Easton,
escorted by a company of Gurkhas, were detailed
to occupy a position on a ridge which overlooked
Palla. The troops fell in at two in the morning.
The night was pitch-dark, but with such care were
the operations conducted that the troops had
made a long d√©tour, and got into their respective
positions before dawn, without an alarm being
raised.</p>

<p>Daylight was just breaking when Captain Shepherd
crept up to the wall of the house on the
extreme left, where it was believed the majority
of the enemy were located, and laid his explosives.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
A tremendous explosion followed, the
whole side of the house falling in. A minute afterwards,
and Palla was alarmed and firing furiously
all round, and even up in the air. The jong also
awoke, and from that time till the village was
finally ours poured a continuous storm of bullets
into Palla, regardless whether friend or foe was
hit. Our guns on the ridge did their best to
quiet the jong, but without much effect. Against
Tibetan walls, provided as they are with head
cover, our experience showed shrapnel to be
almost entirely useless.</p>

<p>A company of Pioneers followed Captain Shepherd
into the breach he had made. But they
found themselves only in a small courtyard, with
no means of entering the rest of the village,
except over or through high walls lined by the
enemy. All that could be done was to blow in
another breach. The preparations for doing this
were attended with a good deal of danger. Of
three men who attempted to rush across the
courtyard, two were killed and the third mortally
wounded. However, by creeping along under
cover of the wall, Captain Shepherd and Lieutenant
Garstin were able to lay the guncotton
and light the fuse for another explosion. They
were fired at from a distance of a few yards, but
escaped being hit by a miracle. But the second
explosion only led into another courtyard, from
which there was also no exit. There was the
same fire to be faced from the next house whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the needful preparations were being made for
making a third breach.</p>

<p>During the time Shepherd with his gallant lieutenants
and equally gallant sepoys was working
his way in from the left, the companies of Pioneers
lining ditches and banks outside Palla were exposed
to a persistent fire from about a hundred
of the enemy inside the big two-storied house
mentioned above. The men in this house&mdash;all
Kham warriors&mdash;seemed to be filled with an extraordinary
fury. Many exposed themselves boldly at
the windows, calling to our men to come on. A
dozen or so even climbed to the roof of the house,
and danced about thereon in what seemed frantic
derision. There was a Maxim on the ridge with
the mountain-guns, the fire from which put an end
to the fantastic display. Our rifle fire, however,
seemed totally unable to check the Tibetan
warriors in the loopholed windows. They kept
up a fusillade which made a rush impossible.
Major Peterson finally, with great daring, led a
few men into the dwelling on the extreme right.
The escalade was managed by means of a ruined
tree which projected from the wall. But Peterson,
like Shepherd, found himself in a courtyard
with high walls which baffled further progress.</p>

<p>The fight now began to drag. Hours passed
without any signal incident. The Tibetans were
greatly elated at the failure of our troops to make
progress. They shouted and yelled, and were
encouraged by answering cheers from the jong.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Then about mid-day the jong Commandant conceived
the idea of reinforcing Palla. A dozen
men mounted on black mules, followed by about
fifty infantry, suddenly dashed out from the half-completed
covered way mentioned above, and
made for the village. This party was absolutely
annihilated. As soon as it emerged from the
covered way it came under the fire, not only of
the troops round the village and on the hill, but
of the Maxim on the roof of the mission-house.
In three minutes every single man and mule was
down, except one animal with a broken leg,
gazing disconsolately at the body of its master.</p>

<p>This disaster evidently shook the Tibetans in
Palla. Their fire slackened. Captain Luke on
the ridge was then directed to put some common
shell into the roof of the double-storied house.
He dropped the shells exactly where they were
wanted, and so disconcerted the enemy that
Shepherd was able to resume his preparations
for making a way into the Tibetan stronghold.
But he still had to face an awkward fire, and the
three further breaches he made were attended
by the loss of several men, including Lieutenant
Garstin, shot through the head. But the last
explosion led our troops into the big house.
Tibetan resistance then practically ceased. About
twenty or thirty men made an attempt to get
away to the jong, but the majority were shot
down before they could reach the covered way.</p>

<p>In this affair our total casualties were twenty-three.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
In addition to Lieutenant Garstin, we had
seven men killed. The wounded included Captain
O'Connor, R.A., secretary to the mission, and
Lieutenant Mitchell, 32nd Pioneers. The enemy
must have lost quite 250 in killed and wounded.
The position at Palla was too important to be
abandoned, and for the rest of the bombardment
it was held by a company of Sikhs. In order to
provide free communication both day and night,
Captain Shepherd, with his usual energy, dug a
covered way from the post to the village.</p>

<p>The fight at Palla was the last affair of any
importance in which the garrison was engaged
pending the arrival of the relieving force. The
Tibetans had received such a shock that in future
they confined themselves practically to the defensive,
if we except five half-hearted night
attacks which were never anywhere near being
pushed home. There were no more attempts to
interrupt our lines of communication, though
later on Naini was again occupied as part of the
Tibetan scheme for resisting General Macdonald's
advance. The jong Commandant devoted his
energies chiefly to strengthening his already strong
position.</p>

<p>The night attacks were all very similar in character,
and may be summed up and dismissed in a
paragraph. Generally about midnight, bands of
Tibetans would issue from the jong and take up
their position about four or five hundred yards from
the post. Then they would shout wildly, and fire
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
off their matchlocks and Martini rifles. The troops
would immediately rush to their loopholes, clad
in impossible garments, and wait shivering in the
cold, finger on trigger, for the rush that never
came. After shouting and firing for about an
hour, the Tibetans would retire to the jong and
our troops creep back to their beds. On no occasion
did the enemy come close enough to be seen
in the dark. We never fired a single shot from
the post. Twice, however, the Gurkha outpost
and the Sikhs at Palla were enabled to get in
a few volleys at Tibetans as they slunk past.
During the night attacks the jong remained silent,
except on one occasion, when there was so much
firing from the Gurkha outpost that the enemy
thought we were about to make a counter-attack.
Every jingal, musket, and rifle in the jong was
then loosed off in any and every direction. We
even heard firing in the rear of the monastery.
Although no one was hit in this wild fire, the
volume of it was ominously indicative of the
strength in which the jong was held.</p>

<p>But even more ominous against the day when
our troops should be called upon to take the jong
were the defensive preparations mentioned above.
Nearly every morning we found that during the
night the enemy had built up a new wall or covered
way somewhere on the jong or about the village
that fringed the base of the rock. When the
fortress was fortified as strongly as Tibetan wit
could devise, the jong Commandant began to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
fortify and place in a position of defence the
villages and monasteries on his right and left.
It was calculated that, from the small monastery
perched on the hills to his left to Tsechen Monastery
on a ridge to his right, the Tibetan General
had occupied and fortified a position with nearly
seven miles of front.</p>

<p>Whilst the Tibetans were engaged in making
these preparations, our garrison was busy collecting
forage for the enormous number of animals
coming up with the relief column. Our rear being
absolutely open, small parties with mules were
able to collect quantities of hay from villages
within a radius of seven miles behind us. It was
the fire opened on these parties when they attempted
to push to the right or left of the jong
which first revealed to us the full extent of the
defensive position occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>On June 6 Colonel Younghusband left the post
with a returning convoy, in order to confer with
the General at Chumbi. This convoy was attacked
whilst halting at the entrenched post at
Kangma. The enemy in this instance came down
from the Karo la, and it is for this reason that I
do not include the Kangma attack amongst the
operations at and around Gyantse.</p>

<p>It was not till June 15 that we got definite news
of the approaching advance of the relief column.
Reinforcements had come up to Chumbi from
India in the interval, and the General was accompanied
by the 2nd Mounted Infantry under Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Peterson, No. 7 British Mountain Battery
under Major Fuller, a section of No. 30 Native
Mountain Battery under Captain Marindin, four
companies of the Royal Fusiliers under Colonel
Cooper, four companies of the 40th Pathans under
Colonel Burn, five companies of the 23rd Pioneers
under Colonel Hogge, and the two remaining companies
of the 8th Gurkhas under Colonel Kerr,
together with the usual medical and other details.</p>

<p>The force arrived at Kangma on June 23. On
the 25th a party of mounted infantry from Gyantse
met Captain Peterson's mounted infantry reconnoitring
at the monastery of Naini, previously
mentioned. Whilst greetings were being exchanged
a sudden fire was opened on our men
from the monastery, which the enemy had apparently
occupied and fortified during the night.
The position was apparently held in strength, and
the mounted infantry had no other course except
to retire to their respective camps. Captain
Peterson had one man mortally wounded.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26th the sentries at the
mission post saw about twenty mounted men,
followed by two or three hundred infantry, issue
from the rear of the jong and creep up the hills
on our left in the direction of Naini. It was
evident that a determined effort was to be made
at the monastery to check the advance of the
relief column, which was expected at Gyantse
next day. Colonel Brander came to the conclusion
that he had found an opportunity for catching
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the Tibetans in a trap. He determined to
send out a force which would block the retreat of
the enemy when they retired before the advance
of the relief column. Accordingly, before dawn
four companies of Pioneers, four guns, and the
Maxim gun left the post, and ascended the hills
overlooking the monastery. Captain Ottley's
mounted infantry were directed to close the road
leading directly from Gyantse to the monastery.</p>

<p>Colonel Brander's forces were in position some
hours before the mounted infantry of the relief
column appeared in sight. It was discovered that
the enemy not only held the monastery, but some
ruined towers on the hill above, and a cluster of
one-storied dwellings in a grove below. Captain
Peterson with his mounted infantry appeared in
front of the monastery at eleven o'clock. He
had with him a company of the 40th Pathans,
and his orders were to clear the monastery with
this small force, if the enemy made no signs of a
stubborn resistance. Otherwise he was to await
the arrival of more troops with the mountain-guns.</p>

<p>Peterson delivered his attack from the left,
having dismounted his troopers, who, together
with the 40th Pathans, were soon very hotly
engaged. The troops came under a heavy fire
both from the monastery and from a ruined
tower above it, but advanced most gallantly.
When under the walls of the monastery, they
were checked for some time by the difficulty of
finding a way in. In the meanwhile, hearing the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
heavy firing, the General and his Staff, followed
by Major Fuller's battery and the rest of the
40th, had hastened up. The battery came into
action against the tower, and the 40th rushed up
in support of their comrades. Colonel Brander's
guns and Maxim on the top of the hill were also
brought into play. For nearly an hour a furious
cannonade and fusillade raged. Then the Pathans
and Peterson's troopers, circling round the walls
of the monastery, found a ramp up which they
could climb. They swarmed up, and were quickly
inside the building. But the Tibetans had realized
that their retreat was cut off, and, instead of
making a clean bolt for it, only retired slowly from
room to room and passage to passage. Two companies
of the 23rd were sent up to assist in clearing
the monastery. It proved a perfect warren of dark
cells and rooms. The Tibetan resistance lasted
for over two hours. Bands of desperate swordsmen
were found in knots under trap-doors and
behind sharp turnings. They would not surrender,
and had to be killed by rifle shots fired at
a distance of a few feet.</p>

<p>While the monastery was being cleared, another
fight had developed in the cluster of dwellings outside
it to the right. From this spot Tibetan riflemen
were enfilading our troops held in reserve.
The remaining companies of the 23rd were sent
to clear away the enemy. They took three houses,
but could not effect an entrance into the fourth,
which was very strongly barricaded. Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Turnbull, walking up to a window with a section,
had three men hit in a few seconds. One man fell
directly under the window. Turnbull carried him
into safety in the most gallant fashion. Then the
General ordered up the guns, which fired into the
house at a range of a few hundred yards. But not
till it was riddled with great gaping holes made by
common shell did the fire from the house cease.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock the Tibetan resistance
had completely died away, and the column resumed
its march towards Gyantse, which was not
reached till dark. But as the transport was
making its slow way past Naini, about half a
dozen Tibetans who had remained in hiding in
the monastery and village opened fire on it. The
Gurkha rearguard had a troublesome task in
clearing these men out, and lost one man killed.</p>

<p>In this affair at Naini our casualties were six
killed and nine wounded, including Major Lye,
23rd Pioneers, who received a severe sword-cut
in the hand.</p>

<p>The General's camp was pitched about a mile
from the mission post, well out of range of the
jong, though our troops whilst crossing the river
came under fire from some of the bigger jingals.
The next day was one of rest, which the troops
badly needed after their long march from Chumbi.
The Tibetans in the jong also refrained from firing.
On the 29th the General began the operations intended
to culminate in the capture of the jong.
His objective was Tsechen Monastery, on the extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
left. But before the monastery could be
attacked, some twelve fortified villages between
it and the river had to be cleared. It proved
a difficult task, not so much on account of the
resistance offered by the enemy&mdash;for after a few
idle shots the Tibetans quickly retired on the
monastery&mdash;as because of the nature of the ground
that had to be traversed. The whole country
was a network of deep irrigation channels and
water-cuts, in the fording and crossing of which
the troops got wet to the skin. However, by four
in the afternoon all the villages had been cleared,
and the Fusiliers were lying in a long grove under
the right front of the monastery.</p>

<p>It was then discovered that not only was
Tsechen very strongly held, but that masses of
the enemy were lying behind the rocks on the
top of the ridge, on the summit of which there
was a ruined tower, also held by fifty or sixty
men. The General sent two companies of Gurkhas
to scale the ridge from the left, whilst the 40th
Pathans were ordered to make a direct assault on
the monastery. A hundred mounted infantry
made their way to the rear to cut off the retreat
of the enemy. Fuller and Marindin with their
guns covered the advance of the infantry. Four
Maxims were also brought into action. Our guns
made splendid practice on the top of the ridge,
and time and again we could see the enemy bolting
from cover. But with magnificent bravery
they would return to oppose the advance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Gurkhas creeping round their flank. The guns
had presently to cease fire to enable the Gurkhas
to get nearer. A series of desperate little fights
then took place on the top of the ridge, the
Tibetans slinging and throwing stones when they
found they could not load their muskets quickly
enough. But as the Gurkhas would not be
stopped, the Tibetans had to move. In the
meanwhile the Pathans worked through the
monastery below, only meeting with small resistance
from a band of men in one house. The
Tibetans fled in a mass over the right edge of
the ridge into the jaws of the mounted infantry
lying in wait below. Slaughter followed.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and the troops made
their way back to camp. Next morning a party
went up to Tsechen, found it entirely deserted,
and set fire to it. The taking of the monastery
cost us the lives of Captain Craster, 40th Pathans,
and two sepoys. Our wounded numbered ten,
including Captains Bliss and Humphreys, 8th
Gurkhas.</p>

<p>On July 1 the General intended assaulting the
jong, but in the interval the jong Commandant
sent in a flag of truce. He prayed for an armistice
pending the arrival of three delegates who were
posting down from Lhasa with instructions to
make peace. As Colonel Younghusband had been
directed to lose no opportunity of bringing affairs
to an end at Gyantse, the armistice was granted,
and two days afterwards the delegates, all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Lamas, were received in open durbar in a large
room in the mission post. Colonel Younghusband,
after having satisfied himself that the delegates
possessed proper credentials, made them a speech.
He reviewed the history of the mission, pointing
out that we had only come to Gyantse because of
the obstinacy and evasion of the Tibetan officials,
who could easily have treated with us at Khamba
Jong and again at Tuna, had they cared to. We
were perfectly willing to come to terms here, and
it rested with the peace delegates whether we went
on to Lhasa or not. Younghusband then informed
the delegates that he was prepared to open
negociations on the next day. The delegates were
due at eleven next morning, but they did not put
in an appearance till three. They were then told
that as a preliminary they must surrender the
jong by noon on the succeeding day. They
demurred a great deal, but the Commissioner was
quite firm, and they went away downcast, with
the assurance that if the jong was not surrendered
we should take it by force. Younghusband, however,
added that after the capture of the fort he
was perfectly willing to open negociations again.</p>

<p>Next day, shortly after noon, a signal gun was
fired to indicate that the armistice was at an
end, and the General forthwith began his preparations
to storm the formidable hill fortress.
The Tibetans had taken advantage of the armistice
to build more walls and sangars. No one
could look at the bristling jong without realizing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
how difficult was the task before our troops, and
without anxiety as to the outcome of the assault
in killed and wounded. But we all knew that
the jong had to be taken, whatever the cost.</p>

<p>Operations began in the afternoon, the General
making a demonstration against the left face of
the jong and Palkhor Choide Monastery. Fuller's
battery took up a position about 1,600 yards
from the jong. Five companies of infantry were
extended on either flank. Both the jong and
monastery opened fire on our troops, and we
had one man mortally wounded. The General's
intention, however, was only to deceive the
Tibetans into thinking that we intended to assault
from that side. As soon as dusk fell, the troops
were withdrawn and preparations made for the
real assault.</p>

<p>The south-eastern face of the rock on which the
jong is built is most precipitous, yet this was
exactly the face which the General decided to
storm. His reasons, I imagine, were that the fringe
of houses at the base of the rock was thinnest on
this side, and that the very multiplicity of sangars
and walls that the enemy had built prevented
their having the open field of fire necessary to
stop a rush. Moreover, down the middle of the
rock ran a deep fissure or cleft, which was commanded,
the General noticed, by no tower or
loopholed wall. At two points, however, the
Tibetans had built walls across the fissure. The
first of these the General believed could be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
breached by our artillery. Our troops through
that could work their way round to either flank,
and so into the heart of the jong.</p>

<p>The plan of operations was very simple. Before
dawn three columns were to rush the fringe of
houses at the base. Then was to follow a storm
of artillery fire directed on all the salient points
of the jong, after which our guns were to make a
breach in the lower wall across the cleft up which
the storming-party was later on to climb.</p>

<p>The action turned out exactly as was planned,
with the exception that the fighting lasted much
longer than was expected, for the Tibetans made
a heroic resistance. The troops were astir shortly
after midnight. The night was very dark, and
the necessary deployment of the three columns
took some hours. However, an hour before dawn
the troops had begun their cautious advance, the
General and his Staff taking up their position at
Palla. The alarm was not given till our leading
files were within twenty yards of the fringe of
houses at the base of the rock. The storm of fire
which then burst from the jong was an alarming
indication of the strength in which it was held.
The heavy jingals were all directed on Palla, and
the General and his Staff had many narrow
escapes. As on the previous occasion when the
jong bombarded us at night, there were moments
when every building in it seemed outlined in
flame.</p>

<p>Of the three columns, only that on the extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
left, Gurkhas under Major Murray, was able to
get in at once. The other two columns were for
the time being checked, so bullet-swept was the
open space they had to cross. From time to time
small parties of two or three dashed across in the
dark, and gained the shelter of the walls of the
houses in front. There were barely twenty men
and half a dozen officers across when Captain
Shepherd blew in the walls of the house most
strongly held. The storming-party came under
a most heavy fire from the jong above. Among
those hit was Lieutenant Gurdon, of the 32nd.
He was shot through the head, and died almost
immediately. The breach made by Shepherd was
the point to which most of the men of the centre
and right columns made, but their progress became
very slow when daylight appeared and the
Tibetans could see what they were firing at. It
was not till nearly nine o'clock that the whole
fringe of houses at the base of the front face of
the rock was in our possession.</p>

<p>Then followed several hours of cannonading and
small-arms fire. The position the troops had now
won was commanded almost absolutely from the
jong. It was found impossible to return the
Tibetan fire from the roofs of the houses we had
occupied without exposing the troops in an unnecessary
degree, but loopholes were hastily made
in the walls of the rooms below, and the 40th
Pathans were sent into a garden on the extreme
right, where some cover was to be had. Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Campbell, commanding the first line, was able to
show the enemy that our marksmen were still in
a position to pick off such Tibetans as were rash
enough to unduly expose themselves. In the
meanwhile, Luke's guns on the extreme right,
Fuller's battery at Palla, and Marindin's guns at
the Gurkha outpost threw a stream of shrapnel
on all parts of the jong.</p>

<p>But it was not till four o'clock in the afternoon
that the General decided that the time had come
to make the breach aforementioned. The reserve
companies of Gurkhas and Fusiliers were sent
across from Palla in the face of very heavy jingal
and rifle fire, and took cover in the houses we had
occupied. In the meanwhile Fuller was directed
to make the breach. So magnificent was the
shooting made by his guns that a dozen rounds
of common shell, planted one below the other,
had made a hole large enough for active men
to clamber through. The enemy quickly saw the
purport of the breach. Dozens of men could be
distinctly seen hurrying to the wall above it.</p>

<p>Then the Gurkhas and Fusiliers began their
perilous ascent. The nimble Gurkhas, led by
Lieutenant Grant, soon outpaced the Fusiliers,
and in ten brief minutes forty or fifty of them
were crouching under the breach. The Tibetans,
finding their fire could not stop us, tore great
stones from the walls and rolled them down the
cleft. Dozens of men were hit and bruised.
Presently Grant was through the breach, followed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
by fifteen or twenty flushed and shouting men.
The breach won, the only thought of the enemy
was flight. They made their way by the back
of the jong into the monastery. By six o'clock
every building in the great fortress was in our
possession.</p>

<p>Our casualties in this affair were forty-three&mdash;Lieutenant
Gurdon and seven men killed, and
twelve officers, including the gallant Grant, and
twenty-three men wounded. These casualties
exclude a number of men cut and bruised with
stones.</p>

<p>Next morning the monastery was found deserted.
It was reported that the bulk of the
enemy had fled to Dongtse, about ten miles up
the Shigatze road. A column was sent thither,
but found the place empty, except for a very
humble and submissive monk.</p>

<p>On the 14th, having waited for over a week in
the hope of the peace delegates putting in an
appearance, the force started on its march to
Lhasa.</p>

<small>GOSSIP ON THE ROAD TO THE FRONT</small></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Ari, Sikkim</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>June 24</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I write</span> in an old forest rest-house on the borders
of British Bhutan.</p>

<p>The place is quiet and pastoral; climbing roses
overhang the roof and invade the bedrooms;
martins have built their nests in the eaves;
cuckoos are calling among the chestnuts down
the hill. Outside is a flower-garden, gay with
geraniums and petunias and familiar English
plants that have overrun their straggling borders
and scattered themselves in the narrow plot of
grass that fringes the forest. Some Government
officer must have planted them years ago, and
left them to fight it out with Nature and the
caretaker.</p>

<p>The forest has encroached, and it is hard to say
where Nature's hand or Art's begins and ends.
Beside a rose-bush there has sprung up the solid
pink club of the wild ginger, and from a bed of
amaryllis a giant arum raises itself four feet
in its dappled, snake-like sheath. Gardens have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
most charm in spots like this, where their mingled
trimness and neglect contrast with the insolent
unconcern of an encroaching forest.</p>

<p>At Ari I am fifty miles from Darjeeling, on the
road to Lhasa.</p>

<p>On June 21 I set my face to Lhasa for the
second time. I took another route to Chumbi,
vi√¢ Kalimpong and Pedong in British Bhutan.
The road is no further, but it compasses some
arduous ascents. On the other hand it avoids
the low, malarious valleys of Sikkim, where the
path is constantly carried away by slips. There
is less chance of a block, and one is above the
cholera zone. The Jelap route, which I strike
to-morrow, is closed, owing to cholera and land-slips,
so that I shall not touch the line of communications
until within a few miles of Chumbi, in
which time my wound will have had a week longer
to heal before I risk a medical examination and
the chance of being sent back. The relief column
is due at Gyantse in a few days; it depends on
the length of the operations there whether I
catch the advance to Lhasa.</p>

<p>Through avoiding the Nathu-la route to
Chumbi I had to arrange my own transport. In
Darjeeling my coolies bolted without putting a
pack on their backs. More were secured; these
disappeared in the night at Kalimpong without
waiting to be paid. Pack-ponies were hired to
replace them, but these are now in a state of
collapse. Arguing, and haggling, and hectoring,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and blarneying, and persuading are wearisome at
all times, but more especially in these close steamy
valleys, where it is too much trouble to lift an
eyelid, and the air induces an almost immoral
state of lassitude, in which one is tempted to dole
out silver indifferently to anyone who has it in
his power to oil the wheels of life. I could fill a
whole chapter with a jeremiad on transport, but
it is enough to indicate, to those who go about in
vehicles, that there are men on the road to Tibet
now who would beggar themselves and their
families for generations for a macadamized highway
and two hansom cabs to carry them and their
belongings smoothly to Lhasa. Before I reached
Kalimpong I wished I had never left the 'radius.'
No one should embark on Asiatic travel who is
not thoroughly out of harmony with civilization.</p>

<p>The servant question is another difficulty. No
native bearer wishes to join the field force. Why
should he? He has to cook and pack and do
the work of three men; he has to make long, exhausting
marches; he is exposed to hunger, cold,
and fatigue; he may be under fire every day;
and he knows that if he falls into the hands of the
Tibetans, like the unfortunate servants of Captain
Parr at Gyantse, he will be brutally murdered and
cut up into mincemeat. In return for which he
is fed and clothed, and earns ten rupees more a
month than he would in the security of his own
home. After several unsuccessful trials, I have
found one Jung Bir, a Nepali bearer, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
attached to me because I forget sometimes to
ask for my bazaar account, and do not object
to his being occasionally drunk. In Tibet the
poor fellow will have little chance of drinking.</p>

<p>My first man lost his nerve altogether, and, when
told to work, could only whine out that his father
and mother were not with him. My next applicant
was an opium-eater, prematurely bent and aged,
with the dazed look of a toad that has been incarcerated
for ages in a rock, and is at last restored
to light and the world by the blow of a mason's
hammer. He wanted money to buy more dreams,
and for this he was willing to expose his poor old
body to hardships that would have killed him in
a month. Jung Bir was a Gurkha and more
martial. His first care on being engaged was
to buy a long and heavy chopper&mdash;'for making
mince,' he said; but I knew it was for the Tibetans.</p>

<p>To reach Ari one has to descend twice, crossing
the Teesta at 700 feet, and the Russett Chu at
1,500 feet. These valleys are hotter than the
plains of India. The streams run east and west,
and the cliffs on both sides catch the heat of
the early morning sun and hold it all day. The
closeness, the refraction from the rocks, and the
evaporation of the water, make the atmosphere
almost suffocating, and one feels the heat the
more intensely by the change from the bracing air
above. Crossing the Teesta, one enters British
Bhutan, a strip of land of less than 300 square
miles on the left bank of the river. It was ceded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to us with other territories by the treaty of 1865;
or, in plain words, it was annexed by us as a
punishment for the outrage on Sir Ashley Eden,
the British Envoy, who was captured and grossly
insulted by the Bhutanese at Punakha in the
previous year. The Bhutanese were as arrogant,
exclusive, and impossible to deal with, in those
days, as the Tibetans are to-day. Yet they have
been brought into line, and are now our friends.
Why should not the Tibetans, who are of the
same stock, yield themselves to enlightenment?
Their evolution would be no stranger.</p>

<p>Nine miles above the Teesta bridge is Kalimpong,
the capital of British Bhutan, and virtually
the foreign mart for what trade passes out of Tibet.
The Tomos of the Chumbi Valley, who have the
monopoly of the carrying, do not go further south
than this. At Kalimpong I found a horse-dealer
with a good selection of 'Bhutia tats.' These excellent
little beasts are now well known to be as
strong and plucky a breed of mountain ponies as
can be found anywhere. I discovered that their
fame is not merely modern when I came across
what must be the first reference to them in
history in the narrative of Master Ralph Fitch,
England's pioneer to India. 'These northern
merchants,' says Fitch, speaking of the Bhutia,
'report that in their countrie they haue very
good horses, but they be litle.' The Bhutias
themselves, equally ubiquitous in the Sikkim
Himalayas, but not equally indispensable, Fitch
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
describes to the letter. At Kalimpong I found
them dirty, lazy, good-natured, independent
rascals, possessed, apparently, of wealth beyond
their deserts, for hard work is as alien to their
character as straight dealing. Even the drovers
will pay a coolie good wages to cut grass for
them rather than walk a mile downhill to fetch
it themselves.</p>

<p>The main street of Kalimpong is laid out in
the correct boulevard style, with young trees protected
by tubs and iron railings. It is dominated
by the church of the Scotch Mission, whose steeple
is a landmark for miles. The place seems to be
overrun with the healthiest-looking English children
I have seen anywhere, whose parents are
given over to very practical good works.</p>

<p>I took the Bhutan route chiefly to avoid running
the gauntlet of the medicals; but another inducement
was the prospect of meeting Father Desgodins,
a French Roman Catholic, Vicar Apostolic
of the Roman Catholic Mission to Western Tibet,
who, after fifty years' intimacy with various
Mongol types, is probably better acquainted with
the Tibetans than any other living European.</p>

<p>I met Father Desgodins at Pedong. The rest-house
here looks over the valley to his symmetrical
French presbytery and chapel, perched on
the hillside amid waving maize-fields, whose spring
verdure is the greenest in the world. Scattered
over the fields are thatched Lamas' houses and
low-storied gompas, with overhanging eaves and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
praying-flags&mdash;'horses of the wind,' as the Tibetans
picturesquely call them, imagining that the prayers
inscribed on them are carried to the good god,
whoever he may be, who watches their particular
fold and fends off intruding spirits as well as
material invaders.</p>

<p>Behind the presbytery are terraced rice-fields,
irrigated by perennial streams, and bordered by
thick artemisia scrub, which in the hot sun, after
rain, sends out an aromatic scent, never to be
dissociated in travellers' dreams and reveries
from these great southern slopes of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>P√®re Desgodins is an erect old gentleman with
quiet, steely gray eyes and a tawny beard now
turning gray. He is known to few Englishmen,
but his adventurous travels in Tibet and his
devoted, strenuous life are known throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>He was sent out from France to the Tibet
Mission shortly after the murder of Krick and
Bourry by the Mishmis. Failing to enter Tibet
from the south through Sikkim, he made preparations
for an entry by Ladak. His journey
was arrested by the Indian Mutiny, when he was
one of the besieged at Agra. He afterwards
penetrated Western Tibet as far as Khanam,
but was recalled to the Chinese side, where he
spent twenty-two perilous and adventurous
years in the establishment of the mission at
Batang and Bonga. The mission was burnt
down and the settlement expelled by the Lamas.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
In 1888 Father Desgodins was sent to Pedong,
his present post, as Pro-vicar of the Mission to
Western Tibet.</p>

<p>With regard to the present situation in Tibet,
Father Desgodins expressed astonishment at our
policy of folded arms.</p>

<p>'You have missed the occasion,' he said; 'you
should have made your treaty with the Tibetans
themselves in 1888. You could have forced them
to treat then, when they were unprepared for a
military invasion. You should have said to them'&mdash;here
P√®re Desgodins took out his watch&mdash;'"It
is now one o'clock. Sign that treaty by five, or
we advance to-morrow." What could they have
done? Now you are too late. They have
been preparing for this for the last fifteen
years.'</p>

<p>Father Desgodins was right. It is the old story
of ill-advised conciliation and forbearance. We
were afraid of the bugbear of China. The British
Government says to her victim after the chastisement:
'You've had your lesson. Now run off
and be good.' And the spoilt child of arrested
civilization runs off with his tongue in his cheek
and learns to make new arms and friends. The
British Government in the meantime sleeps in
smug complacency, and Exeter Hall is appeased.</p>

<p>'But why did you not treat with the Tibetans
themselves?' P√®re Desgodins asked. 'China!'&mdash;here
he made an expressive gesture&mdash;'I have
known China for fifty years. She is not your
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
friend.' Of course it is to the interest of China
to keep the tea monopoly, and to close the market
to British India. Travellers on the Chinese
borders are given passports and promises of assistance,
but the natives of the districts they traverse
are ordered to turn them back and place every
obstacle in their way. Nobody knows this better
than Father Desgodins. China's policy is the
same with nations as with individuals. She will
always profess willingness to help, but protest
that her subjects are unmanageable and out of
hand. Why, then, deal with China at all? We
can only answer that she had more authority in
Lhasa in 1888. Moreover, we were more afraid
of offending her susceptibilities. But that bubble
has burst.</p>

<p>Others who hold different views from P√®re
Desgodins say that this very unruliness of her
vassal ought to make China welcome our intervention
in Tibet, if we engage to respect her claims
there when we have subdued the Lamas. This
policy might certainly point a temporary way out
of the muddle, whereby we could save our face
and be rid of the Tibet incubus for perhaps a year.
But the plan of leaving things to the suzerain
Power has been tried too often.</p>

<p>As I rode down the Pedong street from the presbytery
someone called me by name, and a little,
smiling, gnome-like man stepped out of a whitewashed
office. It was Phuntshog, a Tibetan
friend whom I had known six years previously
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
on the North-East frontier. I dismounted, expecting
entertainment.</p>

<p>The office was bare of furniture save a new
writing-table and two chairs, but heaped round
the walls were piles of cast steel and iron plates
and files and pipes for bellows. Phuntshog explained
that he was frontier trade examiner, and
that the steel had been purchased in Calcutta
by a Lama last year, and was confiscated on the
frontier as contraband. It was material for an
armoury. The spoilt child was making new
arms, like the schoolboy who exercises his muscle
to avenge himself after a beating.</p>

<p>'Do you get much of this sort of thing?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Not now,' he said; 'they have given up trying
to get it through this way.'</p>

<p>A few years ago eight Mohammedans, experts
in rifle manufacture, had been decoyed from a
Calcutta factory to Lhasa. Two had died there,
and one I traced at Yatung. His wife had not
been allowed to pass the barrier, but he was
given a Tibetan helpmate. The wife lived some
months at Yatung, and used to receive large
instalments from her husband; once, I was told,
as much as Rs. 1,400. But he never came back.
The Tibetans have learned to make rifles for
themselves now. Phuntshog had a story about
another suspicious character, a mysterious Lama
who arrived in Darjeeling in 1901 from Calcutta
with 5,000 alms bowls for Tibet, which he said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
he had purchased in Germany. The man was
detained in Darjeeling five months under police
espionage, and finally sent back to Calcutta.</p>

<p>Our Intelligence Department on this frontier
is more alert than it used to be. Dorjieff,
Phuntshog told me, had been to Darjeeling
twice, and stayed in a trader's house at
Kalimpong several days. He wore the dress
of a Lama. The ostensible object of his
journey was to visit the sacred Chorten at
Khatmandu and the shrines of Benares. He
visited these, and was known to spend some
time in Calcutta. On the occasion of the mission
to St. Petersburg Dorjieff and his colleagues
entered India through Nepal, took train to Bombay,
and shipped thence to Odessa. The discovery
of the Lamas' visit to India was almost
simultaneous with their departure from Bombay.</p>

<p>Phuntshog is not an admirer of our Tibetan
policy. We ought to have laid ourselves out, he
said, to influence the Lamas by secret agents, as
Russia did. There was no chance of a compromise
now; they would fight to the death.
Phuntshog said much more which I suspected
was inspired by the daily newspapers, so I
questioned him as to the feelings of the natives
of the district.</p>

<p>'The feeling of patriotism is extinct,' he said;
and he looked at his stomach, showing that he
spoke the truth. 'We Tibetan British subjects
are fed well and paid well by your Government.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
We want nothing more. My family are here.
Now I have no trade to examine.' His eyes
slowly surveyed the room, glanced over his office
table, with its pen and ink and blank paper,
lit on the 150 maunds of cast-steel, and finally
rested on two volumes by his elbow.</p>

<p>'Do you read much?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' he said. 'I have learnt a good
deal from these books.'</p>

<p>They were the Holy Bible and Miss Braddon's
'Dead Men's Shoes.'</p>

<p>'Phuntshog,' I said, 'you are a psychological
enigma. Your mind is like that cast-iron huddled
in the corner there, bought in an enlightened
Western city and destined for your benighted
Lhasa, but stuck halfway. Only it was going
the other way. You don't understand? Neither
do I.'</p>

<p>And here at Ari, as I look across the valley of
the Russett Chu to Pedong, and hear the vesper
bell, I cannot help thinking of that strange conflict
of minds&mdash;the devotee who, seeing further
than most men, has cared nothing for the things
of this incarnation, and Phuntshog, the strange
hybrid product of restless Western energies, stirring
and muddying the shallows of the Eastern
mind. Or are they depths?</p>

<p>Who knows? I know nothing, only that these
men are inscrutable, and one cannot see into their
hearts.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><span>CHAPTER XII</span>

<small>TO THE GREAT RIVER</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I reached</span> Gyantse on July 12. The advance to
Lhasa began on the 14th. As might be expected
from the tone of the delegates, peace negociations
fell through. The Lhasa Government seemed to
be chaotic and conveniently inaccessible. The
Dalai Lama remained a great impersonality, and
the four Shap√©s or Councillors disclaimed all
responsibility. The Tsong-du, or National Assembly,
who virtually governed the country, had
sent us no communication. The delegates' attitude
of <i>non possumus</i> was not assumed. Though
these men were the highest officials in Tibet, they
could not guarantee that any settlement they
might make with us would be faithfully observed.
There seemed no hope of a solution to the deadlock
except by absolute militarism. If the
Tibetans had fought so stubbornly at Gyantse,
what fanaticism might we not expect at Lhasa!
Most of us thought that we could only reach the
capital through the most awful carnage. We
pictured the 40,000 monks of Lhasa hurling
themselves defiantly on our camp. We saw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
them mown down by Maxims, lanes of dead.
A hopeless struggle, and an ugly page in military
history. Still, we must go on; there was no help
for it. The blood of these people was on their
own heads.</p>

<p>We left Gyantse on the 14th, and plunged into
the unknown towards Lhasa, which we had
reason to believe lay in some hidden valley
150 miles to the north, beyond the unexplored
basin of the Tsangpo. Every position on the
road was held. The Karo la had been enormously
strengthened, and was occupied by
2,000 men. The enemy's cavalry, which we had
never seen, were at Nagartse Jong. Gubshi, a
dilapidated fort, only nineteen miles on the road,
was held by several hundred. The Tibetans
intended to dispute the passage of the Brahmaputra,
and there were other strong positions where
the path skirted the Kyi-chu for miles beneath
overhanging rocks, which were carefully prepared
for booby-traps. We had to launch ourselves
into this intensely hostile region and compel
some people&mdash;we did not know whom&mdash;to attach
their signatures and seals to a certain parchment
which was to bind them to good behaviour in the
future, and a recognition of obligations they had
hitherto disavowed.</p>

<p>Our force consisted of eight companies of the
8th Gurkhas, five companies of the 32nd Pioneers,
four companies of the 40th Pathans, four companies
of the Royal Fusiliers, two companies of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Mounted Infantry, No. 30 British Mountain
Battery, a section of No. 7 Native Mountain
Battery, 1st Madras Sappers and Miners, machine-gun
section of the Norfolks, and details.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
23rd Pioneers, to their disgust, were left to garrison
Gyantse. The transport included mule, yak,
donkey, and coolie corps.</p>

<p>The first three marches to Ralung were a repetition
of the country between Kalatso and Gyantse&mdash;in
the valley a strip of irrigated land, green and
gold, with alternate barley and mustard fields
between hillsides bare and verdureless save for
tufts of larkspur, astragalus, and scattered yellow
poppies. To Gyantse one descends 2,000 feet
from a country entirely barren of trees to a valley
of occasional willow and poplar groves; while
from Gyantse, as one ascends, the clusters of trees
become fewer, until one reaches the treeless zone
again at Ralung (15,000 feet). The last grove is
at Gubchi.</p>

<p>I quote some notes of the march from my
diary:</p>

<p>'<i>July 14.</i>&mdash;The villages by the roadside are
deserted save for old women and barking dogs.
The Tibetans came down from the Karo la and
impressed the villagers. Many have fled into the
hills, and are hiding among the rocks and caves.
Our pickets fired on some to-night. Seeing their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
heads bobbing up and down among the rocks,
they thought they were surrounded. Many of
the fugitives were women. Luckily, none were
hit. They were brought into camp whimpering
and salaaming, and became embarrassingly grateful
when it was made clear to them that they were
not to be tortured or killed, but set free. They
were called back, however, to give information
about grain, and thought their last hour had
come.'</p>

<p>'<i>July 16.</i>&mdash;All the houses between Gubchi and
Ralung are decorated with diagonal blue, red, and
white stripes, characteristic of the Ning-ma sect
of Buddhists. They remind me of the walls of
Damascus after the visit of the German Emperor.
Heavy rain falls every day. Last night we
camped in a wet mustard-field. It is impossible
to keep our bedding dry.'</p>

<p>From Ralung the valley widens out, and the
country becomes more bleak. We enter a plateau
frequented by gazelle. Cultivation ceases. The
ascent to the Karo Pass is very gradual. The
path takes a sudden turn to the east through a
narrow gorge.</p>

<p>On the 17th we camped under the Karo la in
the snow range of Noijin Kang Sang, at an elevation
of 1,000 feet above Mont Blanc. The pass
was free of snow, but a magnificent glacier descended
within 500 feet of the camp. We lay
within four miles of the enemy's position. Most
of us expected heavy fighting the next morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
as we knew the Tibetans had been strengthening
their defences at the Karo la for some days.
Volleys were fired on our scouts on the 16th and
17th. The old wall had been extended east and
west until it ended in vertical cliffs just beneath
the snow-line. A second barrier had been built
further on, and sangars constructed on every prominent
point to meet flank attacks. The wall
itself was massively strong, and it was approached
by a steep cliff, up which it was impossible to
make a sustained charge, as the rarefied air at
this elevation (16,600 feet) leaves one breathless
after the slightest exertion. The Karo la was the
strongest position on the road to Lhasa. If the
Tibetans intended to make another stand, here
was their chance.</p>

<p>In the messes there was much discussion as to
the seriousness of the opposition we were likely
to meet with. The flanking parties had a long
and difficult climb before them that would take
them some hours, and the general feeling was
that we should be lucky if we got the transport
through by noon. But when one of us suggested
that the Tibetans might fail to come up to the
scratch, and abandon the position without firing
a shot, we laughed at him; but his conjecture was
very near the mark.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. the troops forming the line of
advance moved into position. The disposition
of the enemy's sangars made a turning movement
extremely difficult, but a frontal attack on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
wall, if stubbornly resisted, could not be carried
without severe loss. General Macdonald sent
flanking parties of the 8th Gurkhas on both sides
of the valley to scale the heights and turn the
Tibetan position, and despatched the Royal
Fusiliers along the centre of the valley to attack
the wall when the opposition had been weakened.</p>

<p>Stretched on a grassy knoll on the left, enjoying
the sunshine and the smell of the warm turf, we
civilians watched the whole affair with our glasses.
It might have been a picnic on the Surrey downs
if it were not for the tap-tap of the Maxim, like a
distant woodpecker, in the valley, and the occasional
report of the 10-pounders by our side,
which made the valleys and cliffs reverberate like
thunder.</p>

<p>The Tibetans' ruse was to open fire from the
wall directly our troops came into view, and then
evacuate the position. They thus delayed the
pursuit while we were waiting for the scaling-party
to ascend the heights.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the Gurkhas on the left signalled
that no enemy were to be seen. At the same
time Colonel Cooper, of the Royal Fusiliers,
heliographed that the wall was unoccupied and
the Tibetans in full retreat. The mounted
infantry were at once called up for the pursuit.
Meanwhile one or two jingals and some Tibetan
marksmen kept up an intermittent fire on the
right flanking party from clefts in the overhanging
cliffs. A battery replied with shrapnel,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213/214]</a><br /></span>
covering our advance. These pickets on the
left stayed behind and engaged our right flanking
party until eleven o'clock. To turn the
position the Gurkhas climbed a parallel ridge,
and were for a long time under fire of their
jingals. The last part of the ascent was along
the edge of a glacier, and then on to the shoulder
of the ridge by steps which the Gurkhas cut in
the ice with their <i>kukris</i>, helping one another up
with the butts of their rifles. They carried rope
scaling-ladders, but these were for the descent.
At 11.30 Major Murray and his two companies
of Gurkhas appeared on the heights, and possession
was taken of the pass. The ridge that the
Tibetans had held was apparently deserted, but
every now and then a man was seen crouching
in a cave or behind a rock, and was shot down.
One Kham man shot a Gurkha who was looking
into the cave where he was hiding. He then ran
out and held up his thumbs, expecting quarter.
He was rightly cut down with <i>kukris</i>. The dying
Gurkha's comrades rushed the cave, and drove
six more over the precipice without using steel
or powder. They fell sheer 300 feet. Another
Gurkha cut off a Tibetan's head with his own
sword. On several occasions they hesitated to
soil their <i>kukris</i> when they could despatch their
victims in any other way.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Gurkhas climbing at the Karo la.</span>
</div>

<p>On a further ridge, a heart-breaking ascent of
shale and boulders, we saw two or three hundred
Tibetans ascending into the clouds. We had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
marked them at the beginning of the action, before
we knew that the wall was unoccupied. Even then
it was clear that the men were fugitives, and
had no thought of holding the place. We could
see them hours afterwards, with our glasses,
crouching under the cliffs. We turned shrapnel
and Maxims on them; the hillsides began to move.
Then a company of Pathans was sent up, and
despatched over forty. It was at this point I
saw an act of heroism which quite changed my
estimate of these men. A group of four were
running up a cliff, under fire from the Pathans
at a distance of about 500 yards. One was hit,
and his comrade stayed behind to carry him.
The two unimpeded Tibetans made their escape,
but the rescuer could only shamble along with
difficulty. He and his wounded comrade were
both shot down.</p>

<p>The 18th was a disappointing day to our
soldiers. But the action was of great interest,
owing to the altitude in which our flanking parties
had to operate. There is a saying on the Indian
frontier: 'There is a hill; send up a Gurkha.'
These sturdy little men are splendid mountaineers,
and will climb up the face of a rock while the
enemy are rolling down stones on them as coolly
as they will rush a wall under heavy fire on the
flat. Their arduous climb took three and a half
hours, and was a real mountaineering feat. The
cave fighting, in which they had three casualties,
took place at 19,000 feet, and this is probably the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
highest elevation at which an action has been
fought in history.</p>

<p>A few of the Tibetans fled by the highroad,
along which the mounted infantry pursued, killing
twenty and taking ten prisoners. I asked a
native officer how he decided whom to spare or
kill, and he said he killed the men who ran, and
spared those who came towards him. The destiny
that preserved the lives of our ten Kham prisoners
when nearly the whole of the levy perished reminded
me in its capriciousness of Caliban's
whim in Setebos:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loving not, hating not, just choosing so.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These Kham men were in our mounted infantry
camp until the release of the prisoners in Lhasa,
and made themselves useful in many ways&mdash;loading
mules, carrying us over streams, fetching
wood and water, and fodder for our horses. They
were fed and cared for, and probably never fared
better in their lives. When they had nothing to
do, they would sit down in a circle and discuss
things resignedly&mdash;the English, no doubt, and
their ways, and their own distant country.
Sometimes they would ask to go home; their
mothers and wives did not know if they were
alive or dead. But we had no guarantee that
they would not fight us again. Now they knew
the disparity of their arms they might shrink
from further resistance, yet there was every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
chance that the Lamas would compel them to
fight. They became quite popular in the camp,
these wild, long-haired men, they were so good-humoured,
gentle in manner, and ready to help.</p>

<p>I was sorry for these Tibetans. Their struggle
was so hopeless. They were brave and simple,
and none of us bore the slightest vindictiveness
against them. Here was all the brutality of war,
and none of the glory and incentive. These
men were of the same race as the people I had
been living amongst at Darjeeling&mdash;cheerful, jolly
fellows&mdash;and I had seen their crops ruined, their
houses burnt and shelled, the dead lying about
the thresholds of what were their homes, and all
for no fault of their own&mdash;only because their
leaders were politically impossible, which, of
course, the poor fellows did not know, and there
was no one to tell them. They thought our
advance an act of unprovoked aggression, and
they were fighting for their homes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, this slaughter was beginning
to put the fear of God into them. We
never saw a Tibetan within five miles who did
not carry a huge white flag. The second action
at the Karo la was the end of the Tibetan resistance.
The fall of Gyantse Jong, which they
thought unassailable, seems to have broken their
spirit altogether. At the Karo la they had
evidently no serious intention of holding the
position, but fought like men driven to the front
against their will, with no confidence or heart
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in the business at all. The friendly Bhutanese
told us that the Tibetans would not stand where
they had once been defeated, and that levies
who had once faced us were not easily brought
into the field again. These were casual generalizations,
no doubt, but they contained a great deal
of truth. The Kham men who opposed us at
the first Karo la action, the Shigatze men who
attacked the mission in May, and the force from
Lhasa who hurled themselves on Kangma, were
all new levies. Many of our prisoners protested
very strongly against being released, fearing to
be exposed again to our bullets and their own
Lamas.</p>

<p>On the 18th we reached Nagartse Jong, and
found the Shap√©s awaiting us. They met us in
the same impracticable spirit. We were not to
occupy the jong, and they were not empowered
to treat with us unless we returned to Gyantse.
It was a repetition of Khamba Jong and Tuna.
In the afternoon a durbar was held in Colonel
Younghusband's tent, when the Tibetans showed
themselves appallingly futile and childish. They
did not seem to realize that we were in a position
to dictate terms, and Colonel Younghusband had
to repeat that it was now too late for any compromise,
and the settlement must be completed
at Lhasa.</p>

<p>From Nagartse we held interviews with these
tedious delegates at almost every camp. They
exhausted everyone's patience except the Commissioner's.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
For days they did not yield a point,
and refused even to discuss terms unless we
returned to Gyantse. But their protests became
more urgent as we went on, their tone less minatory.
It was not until we were within fifty miles
of Lhasa that the Tibetan Government deigned
to enter into communication with the mission.
At Tamalung Colonel Younghusband received the
first communication from the National Assembly;
at Chaksam arrived the first missive the British
Government had ever received from the Dalai
Lama. During the delay at the ferry the councillors
practically threw themselves on Colonel
Younghusband's mercy. They said that their
lives would be forfeited if we proceeded, and
dwelt on the severe punishment they might incur
if they failed to conclude negociations satisfactorily.
But Colonel Younghusband was equal to
every emergency. It would be impossible to find
another man in the British Empire with a personality
so calculated to impress the Tibetans.
He sat through every durbar a monument of
patience and inflexibility, impassive as one of
their own Buddhas. Priests and councillors found
that appeals to his mercy were hopeless. He, too,
had orders from his King to go to Lhasa; if he
faltered, <i>his</i> life also was at stake; decapitation
would await <i>him</i> on his return. That was the
impression he purposely gave them. It curtailed
palaver. How in the name of all their Buddhas
were they to stop such a man?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole progress of negociations put me in
mind of the coercion of very naughty children.
The Lamas tried every guile to reduce his demands.
They would be cajoling him now if he had not
given them an ultimatum, and if they had not
learnt by six weeks' contact and intercourse with
the man that shuffling was hopeless, that he never
made a promise that was not fulfilled, or a threat
that was not executed. The Tibetan treaty was
the victory of a personality, the triumph of an
impression on the least impressionable people in
the world. But I anticipate.</p>

<p>While the Shap√©s were holding Colonel Younghusband
in conference at Nagartse, their cavalry
were escorting a large convoy on the road to
Lhasa. Our mounted infantry came upon them
six miles beyond Nagartse, and as they were
rounding them up the Tibetans foolishly fired on
them. We captured eighty riding and baggage
ponies and mules and fourteen prisoners, and
killed several. They made no stand, though they
were well armed with a medley of modern rifles
and well mounted. This was actually the last
shot fired on our side. The delegates had been
full of assurances that the country was clear of
the enemy, hoping that the convoy would get
well away while they delayed us with fruitless
protests and reiterated demands to go back.
While they were palavering in the tent, they
looked out and saw the Pathans go past with
their rich yellow silks and personal baggage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
looted in the brush with the cavalry. Their
consternation was amusing, and the situation
had its element of humour. A servant rushed
to the door of the tent and delivered the whole
tale of woe. A mounted infantry officer arrived
and explained that our scouts had been fired on.
After this, of course, there was no talk of anything
except the restitution of the loot. The
Shap√©s deserved to lose their kit. I do not remember
what was arranged, but if any readers
of this record see a gorgeous yellow cloak of
silk and brocade at a fancy-dress ball in London,
I advise them to ask its history.</p>

<p>This last encounter with the Tibetans is especially
interesting, as they were the best-armed
body of men we had met. The weapons we
captured included a Winchester rifle, several
Lhasa-made Martinis, a bolt rifle of an old
Austrian pattern, an English-made muzzle-loading
rifle, a 12-bore breech-loading shot-gun, some
Eley's ammunition, and an English gun-case.
The reports of Russian arms found in Tibet have
been very much exaggerated. During the whole
campaign we did not come across more than
thirty Russian Government rifles, and these were
weapons that must have drifted into Tibet from
Mongolia, just as rifles of British pattern found
their way over the Indian frontier into Lhasa.
Also it must be remembered that the weapons
locally made in Lhasa were of British pattern,
and manufactured by experts decoyed from a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
British factory. Had these men been Russian
subjects, we should have regarded their presence
in Lhasa as an unquestionable proof of Muscovite
assistance. Jealousy and suspicion make nations
wilfully blind. Russia fully believes that we are
giving underhand assistance to the Japanese, and
many Englishmen, who are unbiassed in other
questions, are ready to believe, without the
slightest proof, that Russia has been supplying
Tibet with arms and generals. We had been
informed that large quantities of Russian rifles
had been introduced into the country, and it was
rumoured that the Tibetans were reserving these
for the defence of Lhasa itself. But it is hardly
credible that they should have sent levies against
us armed with their obsolete matchlocks when
they were well supplied with weapons of a modern
pattern. Russian intrigue was active in Lhasa,
but it had not gone so far as open armament.</p>

</div>

<p>At Nagartse we came across the great Yamdok
or Palti Lake, along the shores of which winds
the road to Lhasa. Nagartse Jong is a striking
old keep, built on a bluff promontory of hill
stretching out towards the blue waters of the
lake. In the distance we saw the crag-perched
monastery of Samding, where lives the mysterious
Dorje Phagmo, the incarnation of the goddess
Tara.</p>

<p>The wild mountain scenery of the Yamdok
Tso, the most romantic in Tibet, has naturally
inspired many legends. When Samding was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
threatened by the Dzungarian invaders early in
the eighteenth century, Dorje Phagmo miraculously
converted herself and all her attendant
monks and nuns into pigs. Serung Dandub, the
Dzungarian chief, finding the monastery deserted,
said that he would not loot a place guarded only
by swine, whereupon Dorje Phagmo again metamorphosed
herself and her satellites. The terrified
invaders prostrated themselves in awe before
the goddess, and presented the monastery with
the most priceless gifts. Similarly, the Abbot of
Pehte saved the fortress and town from another
band of invaders by giving the lake the appearance
of green pasturelands, into which the Dzungarians
galloped and were engulfed. I quote
these tales, which have been mentioned in nearly
every book on Tibet, as typical of the country.
Doubtless similar legends will be current in a few
years about the British to account for the sparing
of Samding, Nagartse, and Pehte Jong.</p>

<p>Special courtesy was shown the monks and
nuns of Samding, in recognition of the hospitality
afforded Sarat Chandra Dass by the last incarnation
of Dorje Phagmo, who entertained the Bengali
traveller, and saw that he was attended
to and cared for through a serious illness. A
letter was sent Dorje Phagmo, asking if she
would receive three British officers, including the
antiquary of the expedition. But the present
incarnation, a girl of six or seven years, was invisible,
and the convent was reported to be bare
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of ornament and singularly disappointing. There
were no pigs.</p>

<p>If only one were without the incubus of an
army, a month in the Noijin Kang Sang country
and the Yamdok Plain would be a delightful
experience. But when one is accompanying a
column one loses more than half the pleasure of
travel. One has to get up at a fixed hour&mdash;generally
uncomfortably early&mdash;breakfast, and pack
and load one's mules and see them started in their
allotted place in the line, ride in a crowd all day,
often at a snail's pace, and halt at a fixed place.
Shooting is forbidden on the line of march. When
alone one can wander about with a gun, pitch
camp where one likes, make short or long marches
as one likes, shoot or fish or loiter for days in the
same place. The spirit which impels one to
travel in wild places is an impulse, conscious or
unconscious, to be free of laws and restraints,
to escape conventions and social obligations, to
temporarily throw one's self back into an obsolete
phase of existence, amidst surroundings which
bear little mark of the arbitrary meddling of man.
It is not a high ideal, but men often deceive themselves
when they think they make expeditions in
order to add to science, and forsake the comforts
of life, and endure hunger, cold, fatigue and loneliness,
to discover in exactly what parallel of unknown
country a river rises or bends to some
particular point of the compass. How many
travellers are there who would spend the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
time in an office poring over maps or statistics
for the sake of geography or any other science?
We like to have a convenient excuse, and make a
virtue out of a hobby or an instinct. But why
not own up that one travels for the glamour of
the thing? In previous wanderings my experience
had always been to leave a base with several
different objectives in view, and to take the route
that proved most alluring when met by a choice
of roads&mdash;some old deserted city or ruined shrine,
some lake or marshland haunted by wild-fowl
that have never heard the crack of a gun, or a
strip of desert where one must calculate how to
get across with just sufficient supplies and no
margin. I like to drift to the magnet of great
watersheds, lofty mountain passes, frontiers where
one emerges among people entirely different in
habit and belief from folk the other side, but
equally convinced that they are the only enlightened
people on earth. Often in India I had
dreamed of the great inland waters of Tibet and
Mongolia, the haunts of myriads of duck and
geese&mdash;Yamdok Tso, Tengri Nor, Issik Kul,
names of romance to the wild-fowler, to be breathed
with reverence and awe. I envied the great
flights of mallard and pochard winging northward
in March and April to the unknown; and
here at last I was camping by the Yamdok Tso
itself&mdash;with an army.</p>

<p>Yet I have digressed to grumble at the only
means by which a sight of these hidden waters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
was possible. When we passed in July, there
were no wild-fowl on the lake except the bar-headed
geese and Brahminy duck. The ruddy
sheldrake, or Brahminy, is found all over Tibet,
and will be associated with the memory of nearly
every march and camping-ground. It is distinctly
a Buddhist bird. From it is derived the
title of the established Church of the Lamas, the
Abbots of which wear robes of ruddy sheldrake
colour, Gelug-pa.<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In Burmah the Brahminy
is sacred to Buddhism as a symbol of devotion
and fidelity, and it was figured on Asoka's
pillars in the same emblematical character.<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The Brahminy is generally found in pairs, and
when one is shot the other will often hover round
till it falls a victim to conjugal love. In India
the bird is considered inedible, but we were glad
of it in Tibet, and discovered no trace of fishy
flavour.</p>

<p>Early in April, when we passed the Bam Tso
and Kala Tso we found the lakes frequented by
nearly all the common migratory Indian duck;
and again, on our return large flights came in.
But during the summer months nothing remained
except the geese and sheldrake and the goosander,
which is resident in Tibet and the Himalayas. I
take it that no respectable duck spends the
summer south of the Tengri Nor. At Lhasa,
mallard, teal, gadwall, and white-eyed pochard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
were coming in from the north as we were leaving
in the latter half of September, and followed us
down to the plains. They make shorter flights
than I imagined, and longer stays at their fashionable
Central Asian watering-places.</p>

<p>We marched three days along the banks of the
Yamdok Tso, and halted a day at Nagartse.
Duck were not plentiful on the lake. Black-headed
gulls and redshanks were common. The
fields of blue borage by the villages were an
exquisite sight. On the 22nd we reached Pehte.
The jong, a medieval fortress, stands out on the
lake like Chillon, only it is more crumbling and
dilapidated. The courtyards are neglected and
overgrown with nettles. Soldiers, villagers, both
men and women, had run away to the hills with
their flocks and valuables. Only an old man and
two boys were left in charge of the chapel and the
fort. The hide fishing-boats were sunk, or carried
over to the other side. On July 24 we left the
lake near the village of Tamalung, and ascended
the ridge on our left to the Khamba Pass, 1,200
feet above the lake level. A sudden turn in the
path brought us to the saddle, and we looked
down on the great river that has been guarded
from European eyes for nearly a century. In
the heart of Tibet we had found Arcadia&mdash;not a
detached oasis, but a continuous strip of verdure,
where the Tsangpo cleaves the bleak hills and
desert tablelands from west to east.</p>

<p>All the valley was covered with green and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
yellow cornfields, with scattered homesteads surrounded
by clusters of trees, not dwarfish and
stunted in the struggle for existence, but stately
and spreading&mdash;trees that would grace the valley
of the Thames or Severn.</p>

<p>We had come through the desert to Arcady.
When we left Phari, months and months before,
and crossed the Tang la, we entered the
desert.</p>

<p>Tuna is built on bare gravel, and in winter-time
does not boast a blade of grass. Within a mile
there are stunted bushes, dry, withered, and sapless,
which lend a sustenance to the gazelle and
wild asses, beasts that from the beginning have
chosen isolation, and, like the Tibetans, who
people the same waste, are content with spare
diet so long as they are left alone.</p>

<p>Every Tibetan of the tableland is a hermit by
choice, or some strange hereditary instinct has
impelled him to accept Nature's most niggard
gifts as his birthright, so that he toils a lifetime
to win by his own labour and in scanty
measure the necessaries which Nature deals
lavishly elsewhere, herding his yaks on the waste
lands, tilling the unproductive soil for his meagre
crop of barley, and searching the hillsides for
yak-dung for fuel to warm his stone hut and
cook his meal of flour.</p>

<p>Yet north and south of him, barely a week's
journey, are warm, fertile valleys, luxuriant
crops, unstinted woodlands, where Mongols like
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
himself accept Nature's largess philosophically
as the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>It seems as if some special and economical law
of Providence, such a law as makes at least one
man see beauty in every type of woman, even the
most unlovely, had ordained it, so that no corner
of the earth, not even the Sahara, Tadmor, Tuna,
or Guru, should lack men who devote themselves
blindly and without question to live there, and
care for what one might think God Himself had
forgotten and overlooked.</p>

<p>These men&mdash;Bedouin, Tibetans, and the like&mdash;enjoy
one thing, for which they forego most
things that men crave for, and that is freedom.
They do not possess the gifts that cause strife,
and divisions, and law-making, and political
parties, and changes of Government. They have
too little to share. Their country is invaded only
at intervals of centuries. On these occasions they
fight bravely, as their one inheritance is at stake.
But they are bigoted and benighted; they have
not kept time with evolution, and so they are
defeated. The conservatism, the exclusiveness,
that has kept them free so long has shut the
door to 'progress,' which, if they were enlightened
and introspective, they would recognise as a
pestilence that has infected one half of the world
at the expense of the other, making both unhappy
and discontented.</p>

<p>The Tuna Plain is like the Palmyra Desert at
the point where one comes within view of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
snows of Lebanon. It is not monotonous; there
is too much play of light and shade for that.
Everywhere the sun shines, the mirage dances;
the white calcined plain becomes a flock of
frightened sheep hurrying down the wind; the
stunted sedge by the lakeside leaps up like a
squadron in ambush and sweeps rapidly along
without ever approaching nearer. Sometimes a
herd of wild asses is mingled in the dance, grotesquely
magnified; stones and nettles become
walls and men. All the country is elusive and
unreal.</p>

</div>

<p>A few miles beyond Guru the road skirts the
Bamtso Lake, which must once have filled the
whole valley. Now the waters have receded, as
the process of desiccation is going on which has
entirely changed the geographical features of
Central Asia, and caused the disappearance of
great expanses of water like the Koko Nor, and
the dwindling of lakes and river from Khotan to
Gobi. The Roof of the World is becoming less and
less inhabitable.</p>

<p>From the desert to Arcady is not a long journey,
but armies travel slowly. After months of waiting
and delay we reached the promised land. It
was all suddenly unfolded to our view when we
stood on the Khamba la. Below us was a purely
pastoral landscape. Beyond lay hills even more
barren and verdureless than those we had crossed.
But every mile or so green fan-shaped valleys,
irrigated by clear streams, interrupted the barrenness,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
opening out into the main valley east and
west with perfect symmetry. To the north-east
flowed the Kyi Chu, the valley in which Lhasa
lay screened, only fifty-six miles distant.</p>

<p>To the south of the pass lay the great Yamdok
Lake, wild and beautiful, its channels twining
into the dark interstices of the hills&mdash;valleys of
mystery and gloom, where no white man has
ever trod. Lights and shadows fell caressingly
on the lake and hills. At one moment a peak
was ebony black, at another&mdash;as the heavy clouds
passed from over it, and the sun's rays illumined
it through a thin mist&mdash;golden as a field of buttercups.
Often at sunset the grassy cones of the
hills glow like gilded pagodas, and the Tibetans,
I am told, call these sunlit plots the 'golden
ground.'</p>

<p>In bright sunlight the lake is a deep turquoise
blue, but at evening time transient lights and
shades fleet over it with the moving clouds, light
forget-me-not, deep purple, the azure of a butterfly's
wing&mdash;then all is swept away, immersed in
gloom, before the dark, menacing storm-clouds.</p>

<p>On the 25th I crossed the river with the 1st
Mounted Infantry and 40th Pathans. My tent is
pitched on the roof of a rambling two-storied
house, under the shade of a great walnut-tree.
Crops, waist-deep, grow up to the walls&mdash;barley,
wheat, beans, and peas. On the roof are garden
flowers in pots, hollyhocks, and marigolds. The
cornfields are bright with English wild-flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>&mdash;
dandelions, buttercups, astragalus, and a purple
Michaelmas daisy.</p>

<p>There is no village, but farmhouses are dotted
about the valley, and groves of trees&mdash;walnut and
peach, and poplar and willow&mdash;enclosed within
stone walls. Wild birds that are almost tame are
nesting in the trees&mdash;black and white magpies,
crested hoopoes, and turtle-doves. The groves
are irrigated like the fields, and carpeted with
flowers. Homelike butterflies frequent them, and
honey-bees.</p>

<p>Everything is homelike. There is no mystery
in the valley, except its access, or, rather, its inaccessibility.
We have come to it through snow
passes, over barren, rocky wildernesses; we have
won it with toil and suffering, through frost and
rain and snow and blistering sun.</p>

<p>And now that we had found Arcady, I would
have stayed there. Lhasa was only four marches
distant, but to me, in that mood of almost immoral
indolence, it seemed that this strip of
verdure, with its happy pastoral scenes, was the
most impassable barrier that Nature had planted
in our path. Like the Tibetans, she menaced
and threatened us at first, then she turned to us
with smiles and cajoleries, entreating us to stay,
and her seduction was harder to resist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To trace the course of the Tsangpo River from
Tibet to its outlet into Assam has been the goal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of travellers for over a century. Here is one of
the few unknown tracts of the world, where no
white man has ever penetrated. Until quite
recently there was a hot controversy among
geographers as to whether the Tsangpo was the
main feeder of the Brahmaputra or reappeared
in Burmah as the Irawaddy. All attempts to
explore the river from India have proved fruitless,
owing to the intense hostility of the Abor
and Passi Minyang tribes, who oppose all intrusion
with their poisoned arrows and stakes, sharp
and formidable as spears, cunningly set in the
ground to entrap invaders; while the vigilance
of the Lamas has made it impossible for any
European to get within 150 miles of the Tsangpo
Valley from Tibet. It was not until 1882 that
all doubt as to the identity of the Tsangpo and
Brahmaputra was set aside by the survey of the
native explorer A. K. And the course of the
Brahmaputra, or Dihong, as it is called in Northern
Assam, was never thoroughly investigated until
the explorations of Mr. Needham, the Political
Officer at Sadiya, and his trained Gurkhas, who
penetrated northwards as far as Gina, a village
half a day's journey beyond Passi Ghat, and only
about seventy miles south of the point reached by
A. K. from Tibet.</p>

<p>The return of the British expedition from Tibet
was evidently the opportunity of a century for
the investigation of this unexplored country. We
had gained the hitherto inaccessible base, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
were provided with supplies and transport on the
spot; we had no opposition to expect from the
Tibetans, who were naturally eager to help us
out of the country by whatever road we chose,
and had promised to send officials with us to
their frontier at Gyala Sendong, who would
forage for us and try to impress the villagers into
our service. The hostile tribes beyond the frontier
were not so likely to resist an expedition moving
south to their homes after a successful campaign
as a force entering their country from our Indian
frontier. In the latter case they would naturally
be more suspicious of designs on their independence.
The distance from Lhasa to Assam was
variously estimated from 500 to 700 miles. I
think the calculations were influenced, perhaps
unconsciously, by sympathy with, or aversion
from, the enterprise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Shap√©s, it is true, though they promised to
help us if we were determined on it, advised us
emphatically not to go by the Tsangpo route.
They said that the natives of their own outlying
provinces were bandits and cut-throats, practically
independent of the Lhasa Government,
while the savages beyond the frontier were
dangerous people who obeyed no laws. The
Shap√©s' notions as to the course of the river
were most vague. When questioned, they said
there was a legend that it disappeared into a
hole in the earth. The country near its mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
was inhabited by savages, who went about unclothed,
and fed on monkeys and reptiles. It
was rumoured that they were horned like animals,
and that mothers did not know their own children.
But this they could not vouch for.</p>

<p>It was believed that tracks of a kind existed
from village to village all along the route, but
these, of course, after a time would become impracticable
for pack transport. The mules would
have to be abandoned, and sent back to Gyantse
by our guides, or presented to the Tibetan officials
who accompanied us. Then we were to proceed
by forced marches through the jungle, with coolie
transport if obtainable; if not, each man was to
carry rice for a few days. The distance from the
Tibet frontier to Sadiya is not great, and the unexplored
country is reckoned not to be more than
seven stages. The force would bivouac, and, if
their advance were resisted, would confine themselves
solely to defensive tactics. In case of
opposition, the greatest difficulty would be the
care of the wounded, as each invalid would
need four carriers. Thus, a few casualties would
reduce enormously the fighting strength of the
escort.</p>

<p>But opposition was unlikely. Mr. Needham,
who has made the tribes of the Dihong Valley
the study of a lifetime, and succeeded to some
extent in gaining their confidence, considered the
chances of resistance small. He would, he said,
send messages to the tribes that the force coming
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
through their country from the north were his
friends, that they had been engaged in a punitive
expedition against the Lamas (whom the Abors
detested), that they were returning home by the
shortest route to Assam, and had no designs on
the territory they traversed. It was proposed
that Mr. Needham should go up the river as
far as possible and furnish the party with
supplies.</p>

<p>All arrangements had been made for the exploring-party,
which was to leave the main force
at Chaksam Ferry, and was expected to arrive in
Sadiya almost simultaneously with the winding
up of the expedition at Siliguri. Captain Ryder,
R.E., was to command the party, and his escort
was to be made up of the 8th Gurkhas, who had
long experience of the Assam frontier tribes, and
were the best men who could be chosen for the
work. Officers were selected, supply and transport
details arranged, everything was in readiness,
when at the last moment, only a day or two before
the party was to start, a message was received
from Simla refusing to sanction the expedition.
Colonel Younghusband was entirely in favour of
it, but the military authorities had a clean slate;
they had come through so far without a single
disaster, and it seemed that no scientific or
geographical considerations could have any
weight with them in their determination to take
no risks. Of course there were risks, and always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
must be in enterprises of the kind; but I think
the circumstances of the moment reduced them
to a minimum, and that the results to be obtained
from the projected expedition should have entirely
outweighed them.</p>

<p>In European scientific circles much was expected
of the Tibetan expedition. But it has
added very little to science. The surveys that
were made have done little more than modify
the previous investigations of native surveyors.<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>An expedition to the mountains bordering the
Tengri Nor, only nine days north of Lhasa, would
have linked all the unknown country north of the
Tsang po with the tracts explored by Sven Hedin,
and left the map without a hiatus in four degrees
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of longitude from Cape Comorin to the Arctic
Ocean. But military considerations were paramount.</p>

<p>For myself, the abandonment of the expedition
was a great disappointment. I had counted on
it as early as February, and had made all preparations
to join it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> passage of the river was difficult and dangerous.
If we had had to depend on the four
Berthon boats we took with us, the crossing
might have taken weeks. But the good fortune
that attended the expedition throughout did not
fail us. At Chaksam we found the Tibetans had
left behind their two great ferry-boats, quaint old
barges with horses' heads at the prow, capacious
enough to hold a hundred men. The Tibetan
ferrymen worked for us cheerfully. A number
of hide boats were also discovered. The transport
mules were swum over, and the whole force was
across in less than a week.</p>

<p>But the river took its toll most tragically.
The current is swift and boisterous; the eddies
and whirlpools are dangerously uncertain. Two
Berthon boats, bound together into a raft, capsized,
and Major Bretherton, chief supply and
transport officer, and two Gurkhas were drowned.
It seemed as if the genius of the river, offended
at our intrusion, had claimed its price and carried
off the most valuable life in the force. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Major Bretherton's foresight more than anything
that enabled us to reach Lhasa. His loss was
calamitous.</p>

<p>We left our camp at the ferry on July 31, and
started for Lhasa, which was only forty-three
miles distant. It was difficult to believe that in
three days we would be looking on the Potala.</p>

<p>The Kyi Chu, the holy river of Lhasa, flows into
the Tsangpo at Chushul, three miles below Chaksam
ferry, where our troops crossed. The river
is almost as broad as the Thames at Greenwich,
and the stream is swift and clear. The valley is
cultivated in places, but long stretches are bare
and rocky. Sand-dunes, overgrown with artemisia
scrub, extend to the margin of cultivation,
leaving a well-defined line between the green
cornfields and the barren sand. The crops were
ripening at the time of our advance, and promised
a plentiful harvest.</p>

<p>For many miles the road is cut out of a precipitous
cliff above the river. A few hundred
men could have destroyed it in an afternoon, and
delayed our advance for another week. Newly-built
sangars at the entrance of the gorge showed
that the Tibetans had intended to hold it. But
they left the valley in a disorganized state the
day we reached the Tsangpo. Had they fortified
the position, they might have made it stronger
than the Karo la.</p>

<p>The heat of the valley was almost tropical.
Summer by the Kyi Chu River is very different
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
from one's first conceptions of Tibet. To escape
the heat, I used to write my diary in the shade of
gardens and willow groves. Hoopoes, magpies,
and huge black ravens became inquisitive and
confidential. I have a pile of little black notebooks
I scribbled over in their society, dirty and
torn and soiled with pressed flowers. For a
picture of the valley I will go to these. One's
freshest impressions are the best, and truer than
reminiscences.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Nethang.</span></span></p>

<p>In the most fertile part of the Kyi Chu Valley,
where the fields are intersected in all directions
by clear-running streams bordered with flowers,
in a grove of poplars where doves were singing
all day long, I found Atisa's tomb.</p>

<p>It was built in a large, plain, barn-like building,
clean and sweet-smelling as a granary, and innocent
of ornament outside and in. It was the only
clean and simple place devoted to religion I had
seen in Tibet.</p>

<p>In every house and monastery we entered on the
road there were gilded images, tawdry paintings,
demons and she-devils, garish frescoes on the
wall, hideous grinning devil-masks, all the Lama's
spurious apparatus of terrorism.</p>

<p>These were the outward symbols of demonolatry
and superstition invented by scheming priests as
the fabric of their sacerdotalism. But this was
the resting-place of the Reformer, the true son
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of Buddha, who came over the Himalayas to
preach a religion of love and mercy.</p>

<p>I entered the building out of the glare of the
sun, expecting nothing but the usual monsters
and abortions&mdash;just as one is dragged into a
church in some tourist-ridden land, where, if only
for the sake of peace, one must cast an apathetic
eye at the lions of the country. But as the
tomb gradually assumed shape in the dim light,
I knew that there was someone here, a priest or
a community, who understood Atisa, who knew
what he would have wished his last resting-place
to be; or perhaps the good old monk had left a
will or spoken a plain word that had been handed
down and remembered these thousand years, and
was now, no doubt, regarded as an eccentric's
whim, that there must be no gods or demons by
his tomb, nothing abnormal, no pretentiousness
of any kind. If his teaching had lived, how
simple and honest and different Tibet would be
to-day!</p>

<p>The tomb was not beautiful&mdash;a large square
plinth, supporting layers of gradually decreasing
circumference and forming steps two feet in height,
the last a platform on which was based a substantial
vat-like structure with no ornament or
inscription except a thin line of black pencilled
saints. By climbing up the layers of masonry
I found a pair of slant eyes gazing at nothing
and hidden by a curve in the stone from gazers
below. This was the only painting on the tomb.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Never in the thousand years since the good
monk was laid to rest at Nethang had a white
man entered this shrine. To-day the courtyard
was crowded with mules and drivers; Hindus and
Pathans in British uniform: they were ransacking
the place for corn. A transport officer was
shouting:</p>

<p>'How many bags have you, babu?'</p>

<p>'A hundred and seven, sir.'</p>

<p>'Remember, if anyone loots, he will get fifty
<i>beynt</i>' (stripes with the cat-o'-nine-tails).</p>

<p>Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>'What the devil is that old thief doing over
there?' he said, and nodded at a man with
arch√¶ological interests, who was peering about
in a dark corner by the tomb. 'There is nothing
more here.'</p>

<p>'He is examining Atisa's tomb.'</p>

<p>'And who the devil is Atisa?'</p>

<p>And who is he? Merely a name to a few dry-as-dust
pedants. Everything human he did is
forgotten. The faintest ripple remains to-day
from that stone cast into the stagnant waters so
many years ago. A few monks drone away their
days in a monastery close by. In the courtyard
there is a border of hollyhocks and snapdragon and
asters. Here the unsavoury guardians of Atisa's
tomb watch me as I write, and wonder what on
earth I am doing among them, and what spell or
mantra I am inscribing in the little black book
that shuts so tightly with a clasp.

<p>To-morrow we reach Lhasa.</p>

<p>A few hours ago we caught the first glimpse
of the Potala Palace, a golden dome standing
out on a bluff rock in the centre of the valley.
The city is not seen from afar perched on a hill
like the great monasteries and jongs of the
country. It is literally 'hidden.' A rocky promontory
projects from the bleak hills to the
south like a screen, hiding Lhasa, as if Nature
conspired in its seclusion. Here at a distance
of seven miles we can see the Potala and the
Lamas' Medical College.</p>

<p>Trees and undulating ground shut out the
view of the actual city until one is within a
mile of it.</p>

<p>To-morrow we camp outside. It is nearly a
hundred years since Thomas Manning, the only
Englishman (until to-day) who ever saw Lhasa,
preceded us. Our journey has not been easy,
but we have come in spite of everything.</p>

<p>The Lamas have opposed us with all their
material and spiritual resources. They have
fought us with medieval weapons and a medley
of modern firearms. They have held Commination
Services, recited mantras, and cursed us
solemnly for days. Yet we have come on.</p>

<p>They have sent delegates and messengers of
every rank to threaten and entreat and plead
with us&mdash;emissaries of increasing importance as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
we have drawn nearer their capital, until the
Dalai Lama despatched his own Grand Chamberlain
and Grand Secretary, and, greater than these,
the Ta Lama and Yutok Shap√©, members of the
ruling Council of Five, whose sacred persons had
never before been seen by European eyes. To-morrow
the Amban himself comes to meet Colonel
Younghusband. The Dalai Lama has sent him a
letter sealed with his own seal.</p>

<p>Every stretch of road from the frontier to Lhasa
has had its symbol of remonstrance. Cairns and
chortens, and <i>mani</i> walls and praying-flags,
demons painted on the rock, writings on the
wall, white stones piled upon black, have emitted
their ray of protest and malevolence in vain.</p>

<p>The Lamas knew we must come. Hundreds
of years ago a Buddhist saint wrote it in his book
of prophecies, Ma-ong Lung-Ten, which may be
bought to-day in the Lhasa book-shops. He
predicted that Tibet would be invaded and conquered
by the Philings (Europeans), when all of
the true religion would go to Chang Shambula,
the Northern Paradise, and Buddhism would
become extinct in the country.</p>

<p>And now the Lamas believe that the prophecy
will be fulfilled by our entry into Lhasa, and that
their religion will decay before foreign influence.
The Dalai Lama, they say, will die, not by violence
or sickness, but by some spiritual visitation. His
spirit will seek some other incarnation, when he
can no longer benefit his people or secure his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
country, so long sacred to Buddhists, from the
contamination of foreign intrusion.</p>

<p>The Tibetans are not the savages they are
depicted. They are civilized, if medieval. The
country is governed on the feudal system. The
monks are the overlords, the peasantry their
serfs. The poor are not oppressed. They and
the small tenant farmers work ungrudgingly for
their spiritual masters, to whom they owe a blind
devotion. They are not discontented, though
they give more than a tithe of their small income
to the Church. It must be remembered that
every family contributes at least one member to
the priesthood, so that, when we are inclined to
abuse the monks for consuming the greater part
of the country's produce, we should remember
that the laymen are not the victims of class prejudice,
the plebeians groaning under the burden
of the patricians, so much as the servants of a
community chosen from among themselves, and
with whom they are connected by family ties.</p>

<p>No doubt the Lamas employ spiritual terrorism
to maintain their influence and preserve the temporal
government in their hands; and when they
speak of their religion being injured by our intrusion,
they are thinking, no doubt, of another unveiling
of mysteries, the dreaded age of materialism
and reason, when little by little their ignorant
serfs will be brought into contact with the facts
of life, and begin to question the justness of the
relations that have existed between themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and their rulers for centuries. But at present
the people are medieval, not only in their system
of government and their religion, their inquisition,
their witchcraft, their incantations, their
ordeals by fire and boiling oil, but in every aspect
of their daily life.</p>

<p>I question if ever in the history of the world
there has been another occasion when bigotry
and darkness have been exposed with such
abruptness to the inroad of science, when a
barrier of ignorance created by jealousy and fear
as a screen between two peoples living side by
side has been demolished so suddenly to admit
the light of an advanced civilization.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, no doubt, will benefit, and
many abuses will be swept away. Yet there
will always be people who will hanker after the
medieval and romantic, who will say: 'We men
are children. Why could we not have been
content that there was one mystery not unveiled,
one country of an ancient arrested civilization,
and an established Church where men are still
guided by sorcery and incantations, and direct
their mundane affairs with one eye on a grotesque
spirit world, which is the most real thing
in their lives&mdash;a land of topsy-turvy and inverted
proportions, where men spend half their lives
mumbling unintelligible mantras and turning
mechanical prayers, and when dead are cut up
into mincemeat and thrown to the dogs and
vultures?'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>To-morrow, when we enter Lhasa, we will have
unveiled the last mystery <ins class="corr" title="the of">of the</ins> East. There are
no more forbidden cities which men have not
mapped and photographed. Our children will
laugh at modern travellers' tales. They will
have to turn again to Gulliver and Haroun al
Raschid. And they will soon tire of these. For
now that there are no real mysteries, no unknown
land of dreams, where there may still be genii
and mahatmas and bottle-imps, that kind of
literature will be tolerated no longer. Children
will be sceptical and matter-of-fact and disillusioned,
and there will be no sale for fairy-stories
any more.</p>

<p>But we ourselves are children. Why could we
not have left at least one city out of bounds?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Lhasa</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>August 3</i>.</span></p>

<p>We reached Lhasa to-day, after a march of
seven miles, and camped outside the city. As
we approached, the road became an embankment
across a marsh. Butterflies and dragon-flies were
hovering among the rushes, clematis grew in the
stonework by the roadside, cows were grazing in
the rich pastureland, redshanks were calling, a
flight of teal passed overhead; the whole scene
was most homelike, save for the bare scarred
cliffs that jealously preclude a distant view of the
city.</p>

<p>Some of us climbed the Chagpo Ri and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
down on the city. Lhasa lay a mile in front of
us, a mass of huddled roofs and trees, dominated
by the golden dome of the Jokhang Cathedral.</p>

<p>It must be the most hidden city on earth. The
Chagpo Ri rises bluffly from the river-bank like a
huge rock. Between it and the Potala hill there
is a narrow gap not more than thirty yards wide.
Over this is built the Pargo Kaling, a typical
Tibetan chorten, through which is the main gateway
into Lhasa. The city has no walls, but
beyond the Potala, to complete the screen,
stretches a great embankment of sand right
across the valley to the hills on the north.</p>

<span class="r2"><i>August 4</i>.</span></p>

<p>An epoch in the world's history was marked
to-day when Colonel Younghusband entered the
city to return the visit of the Chinese Amban.
He was accompanied by all the members of the
mission, the war correspondents, and an escort
of two companies of the Royal Fusiliers and
the 2nd Mounted Infantry. Half a company of
mounted infantry, two guns, a detachment of
sappers, and four companies of infantry were
held ready to support the escort if necessary.</p>

<p>In front of us marched and rode the Amban's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
escort&mdash;his bodyguard, dressed in short loose
coats of French gray, embroidered in black, with
various emblems; pikemen clad in bright red with
black embroidery and black pugarees; soldiers
with pikes and scythes and three-pronged spears,
on all of which hung red banners with devices
embroidered in black.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Corner of Courtyard of Astrologer's Temple, Nechang.</span>
</div>

<p>We found the city squalid and filthy beyond
description, undrained and unpaved. Not a
single house looked clean or cared for. The
streets after rain are nothing but pools of stagnant
water frequented by pigs and dogs searching
for refuse. Even the Jokhang appeared mean
and squalid at close quarters, whence its golden
roofs were invisible. There was nothing picturesque
except the marigolds and hollyhocks in
pots and the doves and singing-birds in wicker
cages.</p>

<p>The few Tibetans we met in the street were
strangely incurious. A baker kneading dough
glanced at us casually, and went on kneading. A
woman weaving barely looked up from her work.</p>

<p>The streets were almost deserted, perhaps by
order of the authorities to prevent an outbreak.
But as we returned small crowds had gathered
in the doorways, women were peering through
windows, but no one followed or took more than
a listless interest in us. The monks looked on
sullenly. But in most faces one read only indifference
and apathy. One might think the
entry of a foreign army into Lhasa and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
presence of English Political Officers in gold-laced
uniform and beaver hats were everyday
events.</p>

<p>The only building in Lhasa that is at all imposing
is the Potala.</p>

<p>It would be misleading to say that the palace
dominated the city, as a comparison would be
implied&mdash;a picture conveyed of one building
standing out signally among others. This is
not the case.</p>

<p>The Potala is superbly detached. It is not a
palace on a hill, but a hill that is also a palace.
Its massive walls, its terraces and bastions
stretch upwards from the plain to the crest, as if
the great bluff rock were merely a foundation-stone
planted there at the divinity's nod. The
divinity dwells in the palace, and underneath,
at the distance of a furlong or two, humanity
is huddled abjectly in squalid smut-begrimed
houses. The proportion is that which exists
between God and man.</p>

<p>If one approached within a league of Lhasa,
saw the glittering domes of the Potala, and turned
back without entering the precincts, one might
still imagine it an enchanted city, shining with turquoise
and gold. But having entered, the illusion
is lost. One might think devout Buddhists had
excluded strangers in order to preserve the myth
of the city's beauty and mystery and wealth,
or that the place was consciously neglected
and defaced so as to offer no allurements to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
heretics, just as the repulsive women one meets
in the streets smear themselves over with grease
and cutch to make themselves even more hideous
than Nature ordained.</p>

<p>The place has not changed since Manning
visited it ninety years ago, and wrote:&mdash;'There is
nothing striking, nothing pleasing, in its appearance.
The habitations are begrimed with smut
and dirt. The avenues are full of dogs, some
growling and gnawing bits of hide that lie about
in profusion, and emit a charnel-house smell;
others limping and looking livid; others ulcerated;
others starved and dying, and pecked at by
ravens; some dead and preyed upon. In short,
everything seems mean and gloomy, and excites
the idea of something unreal.' That is the Lhasa
of to-day. Probably it was the same centuries
ago.</p>

<p>Above all this squalor the Potala towers
superbly. Its golden roofs, shining in the sun
like tongues of fire, are a landmark for miles, and
must inspire awe and veneration in the hearts of
pilgrims coming from the desert parts of Tibet,
Kashmir, and Mongolia to visit the sacred city
that Buddha has blessed.</p>

<p>The secret of romance is remoteness, whether
in time or space. If we could be thrown back to
the days of Agincourt we should be enchanted at
first, but after a week should vote everything
commonplace and dull. Falstaff, the beery lout,
would be an impossible companion, and Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Hal a tiresome young cub who wanted a good
dressing-down. In travel, too, as one approaches
the goal, and the country becomes gradually
familiar, the husk of romance falls off. Childe
Roland must have been sadly disappointed in the
Dark Tower; filth and familiarity very soon
destroyed the romance of Lhasa.</p>

<p>But romance still clings to the Potala. It is
still remote. Like Imray, its sacred inmate has
achieved the impossible. Divinity or no, he has
at least the divine power of vanishing. In the
material West, as we like to call it, we know how
hard it is for the humblest subject to disappear, in
spite of the confused hub of traffic and intricate
network of communications. Yet here in Lhasa,
a city of dreamy repose, a King has escaped,
been spirited into the air, and nobody is any the
wiser.</p>

<p>When we paraded the city yesterday, we made
a complete circuit of the Potala. There was no
one, not even the humblest follower, so unimaginative
that he did not look up from time
to time at the frowning cliff and thousand sightless
windows that concealed the unknown. Those
hidden corridors and passages have been for centuries,
and are, perhaps, at this very moment, the
scenes of unnatural piety and crime.</p>

<p>Within the precincts of Lhasa the taking of life
in any form is sacrilege. Buddha's first law was,
'Thou shalt not kill'; and life is held so sacred by
his devout followers that they are careful not to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
kill the smallest insect. Yet this palace, where
dwells the divine incarnation of the Bodhisat, the
head of the Buddhist Church, must have witnessed
more murders and instigations to crime than the
most blood-stained castle of medieval Europe.</p>

<p>Since the assumption of temporal power by the
fifth Grand Lama in the middle of the seventeenth
century, the whole history of the Tibetan hierarchy
has been a record of bloodshed and intrigue.
The fifth Grand Lama, the first to receive the title
of Dalai, was a most unscrupulous ruler, who
secured the temporal power by inciting the
Mongols to invade Tibet, and received as his
reward the kingship. He then established his
claim to the godhead by tampering with Buddhist
history and writ. The sixth incarnation was
executed by the Chinese on account of his profligacy.
The seventh was deposed by the Chinese
as privy to the murder of the regent. After the
death of the eighth, of whom I can learn nothing,
it would seem that the tables were turned: the
regents systematically murdered their charge,
and the crime of the seventh Dalai Lama was
visited upon four successive incarnations. The
ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth all died prematurely,
assassinated, it is believed, by their
regents.</p>

<p>There are no legends of malmsey-butts, secret
smotherings, and hired assassins. The children
disappeared; they were absorbed into the Universal
Essence; they were literally too good to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
live. Their regents and protectors, monks only
less sacred than themselves, provided that the
spirit in its yearning for the next state should not
be long detained in its mortal husk. No questions
were asked. How could the devout trace the
comings and goings of the divine Avalokita, the
Lord of Mercy and Judgment, who ordains into
what heaven or hell, demon, god, hero, mollusc,
or ape, their spirits must enter, according to their
sins?</p>

<p>So, when we reached Lhasa the other day, and
heard that the thirteenth incarnation had fled, no
one was surprised. Yet the wonder remains. A
great Prince, a god to thousands of men, has been
removed from his palace and capital, no one
knows whither or when. A ruler has disappeared
who travels with every appanage of state, inspiring
awe in his prostrate servants, whose movements,
one would think, were watched and talked
about more than any Sovereign's on earth. Yet
fear, or loyalty, or ignorance keeps every subject
tongue-tied.</p>

<p>We have spies and informers everywhere, and
there are men in Lhasa who would do much to
please the new conquerors of Tibet. There are
also witless men, who have eyes and ears, but, it
seems, no tongues.</p>

<p>But so far neither avarice nor witlessness has
betrayed anything. For all we know, the Dalai
Lama may be still in his palace in some hidden
chamber in the rock, or maybe he has never left
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
his customary apartments, and still performs his
daily offices in the Potala, confident that there
at least his sanctity is inviolable by unbelievers.</p>

<p>The British Tommy in the meanwhile parades
the streets as indifferently as if they were the
New Cut or Lambeth Palace Road. He looks up
at the Potala, and says: 'The old bloke's done a
bunk. Wish we'd got 'im; we might get 'ome
then.'</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Lhasa</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>August</i> &mdash;.</span></p>

<p>We had been in Lhasa nearly three weeks
before we could discover where the Dalai Lama
had fled. We know now that he left his palace
secretly in the night, and took the northern road
to Mongolia. The Buriat, Dorjieff met him at
Nagchuka, on the verge of the great desert that
separates inhabited Tibet from Mongolia, 100 miles
from Lhasa. On the 20th the Amban told us
that he had already left Nagchuka twelve days,
and was pushing on across the desert to the
frontier.</p>

<p>I have been trying to find out something about
the private life and character of the Grand Lama.
But asking questions here is fruitless; one can
learn nothing intimate. And this is just what
one might expect. The man continues a bogie,
a riddle, undivinable, impersonal, remote. The
people know nothing. They have bowed before
the throne as men come out of the dark into a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
blinding light. Scrutiny in their view would be
vain and blasphemous. The Abbots, too, will
reveal nothing; they will not and dare not.
When Colonel Younghusband put the question
direct to a head Lama in open durbar, 'Have
you news of the Dalai Lama? Do you know
where he is?' the monk looked slowly to left and
right, and answered, 'I know nothing.' 'The
ruler of your country leaves his palace and
capital, and you know nothing?' the Commissioner
asked. 'Nothing,' answered the monk,
shuffling his feet, but without changing colour.</p>

<p>From various sources, which differ surprisingly
little, I have a fairly clear picture of the man's
face and figure. He is thick-set, about five feet
nine inches in height, with a heavy square jaw, nose
remarkably long and straight for a Tibetan,
eyebrows pronounced and turning upwards in a
phenomenal manner&mdash;probably trained so, to
make his appearance more forbidding&mdash;face pockmarked,
general expression resolute and sinister.
He goes out very little, and is rarely seen by the
people, except on his annual visit to Depung,
and during his migrations between the Summer
Palace and the Potala. He was at the Summer
Palace when the messenger brought the news that
our advance was inevitable, but he went to the
Potala to put his house in order before projecting
himself into the unknown.</p>

<p>His face is the index of his character. He is a
man of strong personality, impetuous, despotic,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and intolerant of advice in State affairs. He is
constantly deposing his Ministers, and has
estranged from himself a large section of the
upper classes, both ecclesiastical and official,
owing to his wayward and headstrong disposition.
As a child he was so precociously acute and
resolute that he survived his regent, and so
upset the traditional policy of murder, being the
only one out of the last five incarnations to reach
his majority. Since he took the government of
the country into his own hands he has reduced the
Chinese suzerainty to a mere shadow, and, with
fatal results to himself, consistently insulted and
defied the British. His inclination to a rapprochement
with Russia is not shared by his Ministers.</p>

<p>The only glimpse I have had into the man
himself was reflected in a conversation with the
Nepalese Resident, a podgy little man, very ugly
and good-natured, with the manners of a French
comedian and a face generally expanded in a broad
grin. He shook with laughter when I asked him
if he knew the Dalai Lama, and the idea was
really intensely funny, this mercurial, irreverent
little man hobnobbing with the divine. 'I have
seen him,' he said, and exploded again. 'But
what does he do all day?' I asked. The Resident
puckered up his brow, aping abstraction, and
began to wave his hand in the air solemnly with
a slow circular movement, mumbling '<i>Om man
Padme om</i>' to the revolutions of an imaginary
praying-wheel. He was immensely pleased with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the effort and the effect it produced on a sepoy
orderly. 'But has he no interests or amusements?'
I asked. The Resident could think of
none. But he told me a story to illustrate the
dulness of the man, for whom he evidently had
no reverence. On his return from his last visit
to India, the Maharaja of Nepal had given him
a phonograph to present to the Priest-King.
The impious toy was introduced to the Holy of
Holies, and the Dalai Lama walked round it
uneasily as it emitted the strains of English
band music, and raucously repeated an indelicate
Bhutanese song. After sitting a long while in
deep thought, he rose and said he could not live
with this voice without a soul; it must leave his
palace at once. The rejected phonograph found
a home with the Chinese Amban, to whom it was
presented with due ceremonial the same day.
'The Lama is <i>gumar</i>,' the Resident said, using a
Hindustani word which may be translated, according
to our charity, by anything between 'boorish'
and 'unenlightened.' I was glad to meet a man
in this city of evasiveness whose views were
positive, and who was eager to communicate
them. Through him I tracked the shadow, as it
were, of this impersonality, and found that to
many strangers in Lhasa, and perhaps to a few
Lhasans themselves, the divinity was all clay, a
palpable fraud, a pompous and puritanical dullard
masquerading as a god.</p>

<p>For my own part, I think the oracle that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
counselled his flight wiser than the statesmen who
object that it was a political mistake. He has
lost his prestige, they say. But imagine him
dragged into durbar as a signatory, gazed at by
profane eyes, the subject of a few days' gossip
and comment, then sunk into commonplace,
stripped of his mystery like this city of Lhasa,
through which we now saunter familiarly,
wondering when we shall start again for the
<i>wilds</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>To escape this ordeal he has fled, and to us,
at least, his flight has deepened the mystery
that envelops him, and added to his dignity and
remoteness; to thousands of mystical dreamers
it has preserved the effulgence of his godhead
unsoiled by contact with the profane world.</p>

<p>From our camp here the Potala draws the eye
like a magnet. There is nothing but sky and
marsh and bleak hill and palace. When we look
out of our tents in the morning, the sun is striking
the golden roof like a beacon light to the faithful.
Nearly every day in August this year has opened
fine and closed with storm-clouds gathering from
the west, through which the sun shines, bathing
the eastern valley in a soft, pearly light. The
western horizon is dark and lowering, the eastern
peaceful and serene. In this division of darkness
and light the Potala stands out like a haven, not
flaming now, but faintly luminous with a restful
mystic light, soothing enough to rob Buddhist
metaphysics of its pessimism and induce a mood,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
even in unbelievers, in which one is content to
merge the individual and become absorbed in the
universal spirit of Nature.</p>

<p>No wonder that, when one looks for mystery in
Lhasa, one's thoughts dwell solely on the Dalai
Lama and the Potala. I cannot help dwelling
on the flight of the thirteenth incarnation. It
plunges us into medievalism. To my mind, there is
no picture so romantic and engrossing in modern
history as that exodus, when the spiritual head of
the Buddhist Church, the temporal ruler of six
millions, stole out of his palace by night and was
borne away in his palanquin, no one knows on
what errand or with what impotent rage in his
heart. The flight was really secret. No one but
his immediate confidants and retainers, not even
the Amban himself, knew that he had gone. I
can imagine the awed attendants, the burying of
treasure, the locking and sealing of chests, faint
lights flickering in the passages, hurried footsteps
in the corridors, dogs barking intermittently at
this unwonted bustle&mdash;I feel sure the Priest-King
kicked one as he stepped on the terrace for the
last time. Then the procession by moonlight up
the narrow valley to the north, where the roar of
the stream would drown the footsteps of the
palanquin-bearers.</p>

<p>A month afterwards I followed on his track,
and stood on the Phembu Pass twelve miles north
of Lhasa, whence one looks down on the huge belt
of mountains that lie between the Brahmaputra
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and the desert, so packed and huddled that their
crests look like one continuous undulating plain
stretching to the horizon. Looking across the
valley, I could see the northern road to Mongolia
winding up a feeder of the Phembu Chu. They
passed along here and over the next range, and
across range after range, until they reached the
two conical snow-peaks that stand out of the plain
beside Tengri Nor, a hundred miles to the north.
For days they skirted the great lake, and then, as
if they feared the Nemesis of our offended Raj
could pursue them to the end of the earth, broke
into the desert, across which they must be hurrying
now toward the great mountain chain of Burkhan
Buddha, on the southern limits of Mongolia.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="r1"><span class="smcap">Lhasa</span>,</span><br />
<span class="r2"><i>August 19</i>.</span></p>

<p>The Tibetans are the strangest people on earth.
To-day I discovered how they dispose of their
dead.</p>

<p>To hold life sacred and benefit the creatures are
the laws of Buddha, which they are supposed to
obey most scrupulously. And as they think they
may be reborn in any shape of mammal, bird, or
fish, they are kind to living things.</p>

<p>During the morning service the Lamas repeat
a prayer for the minute insects which they have
swallowed inadvertently in their meat and drink,
and the formula insures the rebirth of these
microbes in heaven. Sometimes, when a Lama's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
life is despaired of, the monks will ransom a yak
or a bullock from the shambles, and keep him a
pensioner in their monastery, praying the good
Buddha to spare the sick man's life for the life
ransomed. Yet they eat meat freely, all save
the Gelug-pa, or Reformed Church, and square
their conscience with their appetite by the pretext
that the sin rests with the outcast assassin, the
public butcher, who will be born in the next
incarnation as some tantalized spirit or agonized
demon. That, however, is his own affair.</p>

<p>But it is when a Tibetan dies that his charity
to the creatures becomes really practical. Then,
by his own tacit consent when living, his body is
given as a feast to the dogs and vultures. This
is no casual or careless gift to avoid the trouble of
burial or cremation. All creatures who have a
taste for these things are invited to the ceremony,
and the corpse is carved to their liking by an
expert, who devotes his life to the practice.</p>

<p>When a Tibetan dies he is left three days in his
chamber, and a slit is made in his skull to let his
soul pass out. Then he is rolled into a ball,
wrapped in a sack, or silk if he is rich, packed
into a jar or basket, and carried along to the
music of conch shells to the ceremonial stone.
Here a Lama takes the corpse out of its vessel and
wrappings, and lays it face downwards on a large
flat slab, and the pensioners prowl or hop round,
waiting for their dole. They are quite tame.
The Lamas stand a little way apart, and see that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
strict etiquette is observed during the entertainment.
The carver begins at the ankle, and cuts
upwards, throwing little strips of flesh to the
guests; the bones he throws to a second attendant,
who pounds them up with a heavy stone.</p>

<p>I passed the place to-day as I rode in from a
reconnaissance. The slab lies a stone's-throw
to the left of the great northern road to Tengri
Nor and Mongolia, about two miles from the city.</p>

<p>A group of stolid vultures, too demoralized to
range in search of carrion, stood motionless on a
rock above, waiting the next dispenser of charity.</p>

<p>A few ravens hopped about sadly; they, too,
were evidently pauperized. One magpie was
prying round in suspicious proximity, and dogs
conscious of shame slunk about without a bark
in them, and nosed the ground diligently. They
are always there, waiting.</p>

<p>There was hardly a stain on the slab, so quick
and eager are the applicants for charity. Only
a few rags lay around, too poor to be carried away.</p>

<p>I have not seen the ceremony, and I have no
mind to. My companion this morning, a hardened
young subaltern who was fighting nearly every
day in April, May, and June, and has seen more
bloodshed than most veterans, saw just as much
as I have described. He then felt very ill, dug
his spurs into his horse, and rode away.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a><span>CHAPTER XIV</span>

<small>THE CITY AND ITS TEMPLES</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the first week in September I had visited all
the most important temples and monasteries in
Lhasa. We generally went in parties of four and
five, and a company of Sikhs or Pathans was left
in the courtyard in case of accidents. We were
well armed, as the monks were sullen, though I
do not think they were capable of any desperate
fanaticism. If they had had the abandon of
dervishes, they might have rushed our camp long
before. They missed their chance at Gyantse,
when a night attack pushed home by overwhelming
numbers could have wiped out our little garrison.
In Lhasa there was the one case of the
Lama who ran amuck outside the camp with the
coat of mail and huge paladin's sword concealed
beneath his cloak, a medieval figure who thrashed
the air with his brand like a flail in sheer lust of
blood. He was hanged medievally the next day
within sight of Lhasa. Since then the exploit
has not been repeated, but no one leaves the
perimeter unarmed.</p>

<p>I have written of the squalor of the Lhasa
streets. The environs of the city are beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
enough&mdash;willow groves intersected by clear-running
streams, walled-in parks with palaces and
fish-ponds, marshes where the wild-duck flaunt
their security, and ripe barley-fields stretching
away to the hills. In September the trees
were wearing their autumn tints, the willows
were mostly a sulphury yellow, and in the pools
beneath the red-stalked <i>polygonum</i> and burnished
dock-leaf glowed in brilliant contrast. Just before
dusk there was generally a storm in the valley,
which only occasionally reached the city; but the
breeze stirred the poplars, and the silver under the
leaves glistened brightly against the background
of clouds. Often a rainbow hung over the Potala
like a nimbus.</p>

<p>On the Lingkhor, or circular road, which winds
round Lhasa, we saw pilgrims and devotees moving
slowly along in prayer, always keeping the Potala
on their right hand. The road is only used for
devotion. One meets decrepit old women and
men, halting and limping and slowly revolving
their prayer-wheels and mumbling charms. I
never saw a healthy yokel or robust Lama performing
this rite. Nor did I see the pilgrims
whom one reads of as circumambulating the city
on their knees by a series of prostrations, bowing
their heads in the dust and mud. All the devotees
are poor and ragged, and many blind. It seems
that the people of Lhasa do not begin to think
of the next incarnation until they have nothing
left in this.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>When one leaves the broad avenues between the
walls of the groves and pleasure-gardens, and
enters the city, one's senses are offended by everything
that is unsightly and unclean. Pigs and
pariah dogs are nosing about in black oozy mud.
The houses are solid but dirty. It is hard to
believe that they are whitewashed every year.</p>

<p>Close to the western entrance are the huts of
the Ragyabas, beggars, outcasts, and scavengers,
who cut up the dead. The outer walls of their
houses are built of yak-horns.</p>

<p>Some of the houses had banks of turf built up
outside the doors, with borders of English flowers.
The dwellings are mostly two or three storied.
Bird-cages hang from the windows.</p>

<p>The outside of the cathedral is not at all imposing.
From the streets one cannot see the
golden roof, but only high blank walls, and at
the entrance a forest of dingy pillars beside a
massive door. The door is thrown open by a
sullen monk, and a huge courtyard is revealed
with more dingy pillars that were once red. The
entire wall is covered with paintings of Buddhist
myth and symbolism. The colours are subdued
and pleasing. In the centre of the yard are
masses of hollyhocks, marigolds, nasturtiums, and
stocks. Beside the flower-borders is a pyramidical
structure in which are burnt the leaves
of juniper and pine for sacrifice.</p>

<p>The cloisters are two-storied; on the upper
floor the monks have their cells. Looking up,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
one can see hundreds of them gazing at us with
interest over the banisters. The upper story, as
in every temple in Tibet, is coated with a dark
red substance which looks like rough paint, but
is really sacred earth, pasted on to evenly-clipped
brushwood so as to seem like a continuation of the
masonry. On the face of the wall are emblems in
gilt, Buddhist symbols, like our Prince of Wales's
feathers, sun and crescent moon, and various other
devices. A heavy curtain of yak-hair hangs above
the entrance-gate. On the roof are large cylinders
draped in yak-hair cloth topped by a crescent or
a spear. Every monastery and jong, and most
houses in Tibet, are ornamented with these.
When one first sees them in the distance they
look like men walking on the roof.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />Street Scene in Lhasa.</span>
</div>

<p>Generally one ascends steps from the outer
courtyard to the temple, but in the Jokhang the
floors are level. We enter the main temple by a
dark passage. The great doorway that opens
into the street has been closed behind us, but we
leave a company of Pathans in the outer yard,
as the monks are sullen. Our party of four is
armed with revolvers.</p>

<p>Service is being held before the great Buddhas
as we enter, and a thunderous harmony like an
organ-peal breaks the interval for meditation.
The Abbot, who is in the centre, leans forward
from his chair and takes a bundle of peacock-feathers
from a vase by his side. As he points
it to the earth there is a clashing of cymbals, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
beating of drums, and a blowing of trumpets and
conch shells.</p>

<p>Then the music dies away like the reverberation
of cannon in the hills. The Abbot begins the
chant, and the monks, facing each other like
singing-men in a choir, repeat the litany. They
have extraordinary deep, devotional voices, at
once unnatural and impressive. The deepest
bass of the West does not approach it, and their
sense of time is perfect.</p>

<p>The voice of the thousand monks is like the
drone of some subterranean monster, musically
plaintive&mdash;the wail of the Earth God praying for
release to the God of the Skies.</p>

<p>The chant sounds like the endless repetition of
the same formula; the monks sway to it rhythmically.
The temple would be dark if it were not
for the flickering of many thousands of votive
candles and butter lamps. Rows upon rows of
them are placed before every shrine.</p>

<p>In an inner temple we found the three great
images of the Buddhist trinity&mdash;the Buddhas of
the past, present, and future. The images were
greater than life-size, and set with jewels from
foot to crown. As in the cloisters of an English
cathedral, there were little side-chapels, which
held sacred relics and shrines.</p>

<p>There were lamps of gold, and solid golden
bowls set on altars, and embossed salvers of copper
and bronze.</p>

<p>A hanging grille of chainwork protected the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
precincts from sacrilege, and an extended hand,
bloody and menacing, was stretched from the
wall, terrible enough when suddenly revealed in
that dim light to paralyze and strike to earth
with fright any profane thief who would dare to
enter.</p>

<p>In the upper story we found a place which we
called 'Hell,' where some Lamas were worshipping
the demon protectress of the Grand Lama. The
music here was harsh and barbaric. There were
displayed on the pillars and walls every freak of
diabolical invention in the shape of scrolls and
devil-masks. The obscene object of this worship
was huddled in a corner&mdash;a dwarfish abortion,
hideous and malignant enough for such rites.</p>

<p>All about the Lamas' feet ran little white mice
searching for grain. They are fed daily, and are
scrupulously reverenced, as in their frail white
bodies the souls of the previous guardians of the
shrine are believed to be reincarnated.</p>

<p>In another temple we found the Lamas holding
service in worship of the many-handed Buddha,
Avalokitesvara. The picture of the god hung
from pillars by the altar. The chief Lamas were
wearing peaked caps picturesquely coloured with
subdued blue and gold, and vestments of the
same hue. The lesser Lamas were bare-headed,
and their hair was cropped.</p>

<p>When we first entered, an acolyte was pouring
tea out of a massive copper pot with a turquoise
on the spout. Each monk received his tea in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
wooden bowl, and poured in barley-flour to make
a paste.</p>

<p>During this interval no one spoke or whispered.
The footsteps of the acolytes were noiseless.
Only the younger ones looked up at us self-consciously
as we watched them from a latticed
window in the corridor above.</p>

<p>Centuries ago this service was ordained, and
the intervals appointed to further the pursuit
of truth through silence and abstraction. The
monks sat there quiet as stone. They had seen
us, but they were seemingly oblivious.</p>

<p>One wondered, were they pursuing truth or were
they petrified by ritual and routine? Did they
regard us as immaterial reflexes, unsubstantial
and illusory, passing shadows of the world cast
upon them by an instant's illusion, to pass away
again into the unreal, while they were absorbed
in the contemplation of changeless and universal
truths? Or were we noted as food for gossip
and criticism when their self-imposed ordeal was
done?</p>

<p>The reek of the candles was almost suffocating.
'Thank God I am not a Lama!' said a subaltern
by my side. An Afridi Subadar let the butt of
his rifle clank from his boot to the pavement.</p>

<p>At these calls to sanity we clattered out of
this unholy atmosphere of dreams as if by an
unquestioned impulse into the bright sunshine
outside.</p>

<p>In the bazaar there is a gay crowd. The streets
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
are thronged by as good-natured a mob as I have
met anywhere. Sullenness and distrust have
vanished. Officers and men, Tommies, Gurkhas,
Sikhs, and Pathans, are stared at and criticised
good-humouredly, and their accoutrements fingered
and examined. It is a bright and interesting
crowd, full of colour. In a corner of the square
a street singer with a guitar and dancing children
attracts a small crowd. His voice is a rich baritone,
and he yodels like the Tyrolese. The crowd
is parted by a Shap√© riding past in gorgeous yellow
silks and brocades, followed by a mounted retinue
whose head-gear would be the despair of an
operatic hatter. They wear red lamp-shades,
yellow motor-caps, exaggerated Gainsboroughs,
inverted cooking-pots, coal-scuttles, and medieval
helmets. And among this topsy-turvy, which does
not seem out of place in Lhasa, the most eccentrically-hatted
man is the Bhutanese Tongsa
Penlop, who parades the streets in an English
gray felt hat.</p>

<p>The Mongolian caravan has arrived in Lhasa,
after crossing a thousand miles of desert and
mountain tracks. The merchants and drivers
saunter about the streets, trying not to look too
rustic. But they are easily recognisable&mdash;tall,
sinewy men, very independent in gait, with faces
burnt a dark brick red by exposure to the wind
and sun. I saw one of their splendidly robust
women, clad in a sheepskin cloak girdled at the
waist, bending over a cloth stall, and fingering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
samples as if shopping were the natural business
of her life.</p>

<p>On fine days the wares are spread on the cobbles
of the street, and the coloured cloth and china
make a pretty show against the background of
garden flowers. At the doors of the shops stand
pale Nuwaris, whose ancestors from Nepal settled
in Lhasa generations ago. They wear a flat
brown cap, and a dull russet robe darker than
that of the Lamas. The Cashmiri shopkeepers
are turbaned, and wear a cloak of butcher's blue.
They and the Nuwaris and the Chinese seem to
monopolize the trade of the city.</p>

<p>British officers haunt the bazaars searching for
curios, but with very little success. Lhasa has
no artistic industries; nearly all the knick-knacks
come from India and China. Cloisonn√© ware is
rare and expensive, as one has to pay for the
1,800 miles of transport from Peking. Religious
objects are not sold. Turquoises are plentiful,
but coarse and inferior. Hundreds of paste
imitations have been bought. There is a certain
sale for amulets, rings, bells, and ornaments for
the hair, but these and the brass and copper work
can be bought for half the price in the Darjeeling
bazaar. The few relics we have found of the
West must have histories. In the cathedral there
was a bell with the inscription 'Te Deum laudamus,'
probably a relic of the Capuchins. In the
purlieus of the city we found a bicycle without
tyres, and a sausage-machine made in Birmingham.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of the cathedral, most of
the temples and monasteries are on the outskirts
of the city. There is a sameness about these
places of worship that would make description
tedious. Only the Ramo-ch√© and Moru temples,
which are solely devoted to sorcery, are different.
Here one sees the other soul-side of the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption"><br />Mongolians in Lhasa.</span>
</div>

<p>The Ramo-ch√© is as dark and dingy as a vault.
On each side of the doorway are three gigantic
tutelary demons. In the vestibule is a collection
of bows, arrows, chain-armour, stag-horns, stuffed
animals, scrolls, masks, skulls, and all the paraphernalia
of devil-worship. On the left is a dark
recess where drums are being beaten by an unseen
choir.</p>

<p>A Lama stands, chalice in hand, before a deep
aperture cut in the wall like a buttery hatch, and
illumined by dim, flickering candles, which reveal
a malignant female fiend. As a second priest
pours holy water into a chalice, the Lama raises
it solemnly again and again, muttering spells to
propitiate the fury.</p>

<p>In the hall there are neither ornaments, gods,
hanging canopies, nor scrolls, as in the other
temples. There is neither congregation nor
priests. The walls are apparently black and unpainted,
but here and there a lamp reveals a
Gorgon's head, a fiend's eye, a square inch or two
of pigment that time has not obscured.</p>

<p>The place is immemorially old. There are huge
vessels of carved metal and stone, embossed, like
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the roof, with griffins and skulls, which probably
date back to before the introduction of Buddhism
into Tibet, and are survivals of the old Bon
religion. There is nothing bright here in colour
or sound, nothing vivid or animated.</p>

<p>Stricken men and women come to remove a
curse, vindictive ones to inflict one, bereaved ones
to pay the initiated to watch the adventures of
the soul in purgatory and guide it on its passage
to the new birth, while demons and furies are
lurking to snatch it with fiery claws and drag it
to hell.</p>

<p>All these beings must be appeased by magic
rites. So in the Ramo-ch√© there is no rapture of
music, no communion with Buddha, no beatitudes,
only solitary priests standing before the shrines
and mumbling incantations, dismal groups of two
or three seated Buddha-fashion on the floor, and
casting spells to exercise a deciding influence, as
they hope, in the continual warfare which is
being waged between the tutelary and malignant
deities for the prize of a soul.</p>

<p>In the chancel of the temple, behind the altar, is
a massive pile of masonry stretching from floor
to roof, under which, as folk believe, an abysmal
chasm leads down to hell. Round this there is a
dark and narrow passage which pilgrims circumambulate.
The floor and walls are as slippery as
ice, worn by centuries of pious feet and groping
hands. One old woman in some urgent need is
drifting round and round abstractedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsewhere one might linger in the place fascinated,
but here in Lhasa one moves among
mysteries casually; for one cannot wonder, in this
isolated land where the elements are so aggressive,
among these deserts and wildernesses, heaped
mountain chains, and impenetrable barriers of
snow, that the children of the soil believe that
earth, air, and water are peopled by demons who
are struggling passionately over the destinies of
man.</p>

<p>I will not describe any more of the Lhasa
temples. One shrine is very like another, and
details would be tedious. Personally, I do not
care for systematic sightseeing, even in Lhasa,
but prefer to loiter about the streets and bazaars,
and the gardens outside the city, watch the people,
and enjoy the atmosphere of the place. The
religion of Tibet is picturesque enough in an
unwholesome way, but to inquire how the layers
of superstition became added to the true faith,
and trace the growth of these spurious accretions,
I leave to arch√¶ologists. Perhaps one reader in
a hundred will be interested to know that a temple
was built by the illustrious Konjo, daughter of the
Emperor Tai-Tsung and wife of King Srong-btsan-gombo,
but I think the other ninety and nine will
be devoutly thankful if I omit to mention it.</p>

<p>Yet one cannot leave the subject of the Lhasa
monasteries without remarking on the striking
resemblance between Tibetan Lamaism and the
Romish Church. The resemblance cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
accidental. The burning of candles before altars,
the sprinkling of holy water, the chanting of
hymns in alternation, the giving alms and saying
Masses for the dead, must have their origin in the
West. We know that for many centuries large
Christian communities have existed in Western
China near the Tibetan frontier, and several
Roman Catholic missionaries have penetrated to
Lhasa and other parts of Tibet during the last
three centuries. As early <ins class="corr" title="a">as</ins> 1641 the Jesuit
Father Grueber visited Lhasa, and recorded that
the Lamas wore caps and mitres, that they used
rosaries, bells, and censers, and observed the
practice of confession, penance, and absolution.
Besides these points common to Roman Catholicism,
he noticed the monastic and conventual
system, the tonsure, the vows of poverty, chastity,
and obedience, the doctrine of incarnation and the
Trinity, and the belief in purgatory and paradise.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>We occasionally saw a monk with the refined
ascetic face of a Roman Cardinal. Te Rinpoche,
the acting regent, was an example. One or two
looked as if they might be humane and benevolent&mdash;men
who might make one accept the gentle old
Lama in 'Kim' as a not impossible fiction; but
most of them appeared to me to be gross and
sottish. I must confess that during the protracted
negociations at Lhasa I had little sympathy with
the Lamas. It is a mistake to think that they
keep their country closed out of any religious
scruple. Buddhism in its purest form is not
exclusive or fanatical. Sakya Muni preached a
missionary religion. He was Christlike in his
universal love and his desire to benefit all living
creatures. But Buddhism in Tibet has become
more and more degenerate, and the Lamaist
Church is now little better than a political
mechanism whose chief function is the uncompromising
exclusion of foreigners. The Lamas
know that intercourse with other nations must
destroy their influence with the people.</p>

<p>And Tibet is really ruled by the Lamas. Outside
Lhasa are the three great monasteries of
Depung, Sera, and Gaden, whose Abbots, backed
by a following of nearly 30,000 armed and bigoted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
monks, maintain a preponderating influence in
the national assembly.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> These men wield a
greater influence than the four Shap√©s or the
Dalai Lama himself, and practically dictate the
policy of the country.</p>

<p>The three great monasteries are of ancient
foundation, and intimately associated with the
history of the country. They are, in fact, ecclesiastical
Universities,<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and resemble in many ways
our Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The
Universities are divided into colleges. Each has
its own Abbot, or Master, and disciplinary staff.
The undergraduates, or candidates for ordination,
must attend lectures and chapels, and pass
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
examinations in set books, which they must learn
from cover to cover before they can take their
degree. Failure in examination, as well as
breaches in discipline and manners, are punished
by flogging. Corporal punishment is also dealt
out to the unfortunate tutors, who are held
responsible for their pupils' omissions. If a
candidate repeatedly fails to pass his examination,
he is expelled from the University, and can only
enter again on payment of increased fees. The
three leading Universities are empowered to confer
degrees which correspond to our Bachelor and
Doctor of Divinity. The monks live in rooms in
quadrangles, and have separate messing clubs,
but meet for general worship in the cathedral.
If their code is strictly observed, which I very
much doubt, prayers and tedious religious observances
must take up nearly their whole day.
But the Lamas are adept casuists, and generally
manage to evade the most irksome laws of their
scriptures.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival in Lhasa we had occasion
to visit Depung, which is probably the largest
monastery in the world. It stands in a natural
amphitheatre in the hillside two miles from the
city, a huge collection of temples and monastic
buildings, larger, and certainly more imposing,
than most towns in Tibet.</p>

<p>The University was founded in 1414, during the
reign of the first Grand Lama of the Reformed
Church. It is divided into four colleges, and contains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
nearly 8,000 monks, amongst whom there
is a large Mongolian community. The fourth
Grand Lama, a Mongolian, is buried within the
precincts. The fifth and greatest Dalai Lama,
who built the Potala and was the first to combine
the temporal and spiritual power, was an Abbot
of Depung. The reigning Dalai Lama visits
Depung annually, and a palace in the university
is reserved for his use. The Abbot, of course, is
a man of very great political influence.</p>

<p>All these facts I have collected to show that the
monks have some reason to be proud of their
monastery as the first in Tibet. One may forgive
them a little pride in its historic distinctions.
Even in our own alma mater we meet the best
of men who seem to gather importance from old
traditions and association with a long roll of distinguished
names. What, then, can we expect of
this Tibetan community, the most conservative
in a country that has prided itself for centuries
on its bigotry and isolation&mdash;men who are ignorant
of science, literature, history, politics, everything,
in fact, except their own narrow priestcraft and
confused metaphysics? We call the Tibetan
'impossible.' His whole education teaches him
to be so, and the more educated he is the more
'impossible' he becomes.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, the consternation at Depung
when a body of armed men rode up to the monastery
and demanded supplies. We had refrained
from entering the monasteries of Lhasa and its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
neighbourhood at the request of the Abbots and
Shap√©s, but only on condition that the monks
should bring in supplies, which were to be paid
for at a liberal rate. The Abbots failed to keep
their promise, supplies were not forthcoming, and
it became necessary to resort to strong measures.
An officer was sent to the gate with an escort of
three men and a letter saying that if the provisions
were not handed over within an hour we would
break into the monastery and take them, if necessary,
by force. The messengers were met by a
crowd of excited Lamas, who refused to accept
the letter, waved them away, and rolled stones
towards them menacingly, as an intimation that
they were prepared to fight. As the messengers
rode away the tocsin was heard, warning the
villagers, women and children, who were gathered
outside with market produce, to depart.</p>

<p>General Macdonald with a strong force of
British and native troops drew up within 1,300
yards of the monastery, guns were trained on
Depung, the infantry were deployed, and we
waited the expiration of the period of grace
intimated in the letter. An hour passed by, and
it seemed as if military operations were inevitable,
when groups of monks came out with a white
flag, carrying baskets of eggs and a complimentary
scarf.</p>

<p>Even in the face of this military display they
began to temporize. They bowed and chattered
and protested in their usual futile manner, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
condescended so far as to say they would talk
the matter over if we retired at once, and send
the supplies to our camp the next day, if they
came to a satisfactory decision. The Lamas are
trained to wrangle and dispute and defer and
vacillate.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> They seem to think that speech was
made only to evade conclusions. The curt ultimatum
was repeated, and the deputation was
removed gently by two impassive sepoys, still
chattering like a flock of magpies.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we sat and waited and smoked
our pipes, and wondered if there were going to be
another Guru. It seemed the most difficult thing
in the world to save these poor fools from the
effects of their obstinate folly. The time-limit
had nearly expired, the two batteries were advanced
300 yards, the gunners took their sights
again, and trained the 10-pounders on the very
centre of the monastery.</p>

<p>There were only five minutes more, and we were
stirred, according to our natures, by pity or
exasperation or the swift primitive instinct for
the dramatic, which sweeps away the humanities,
and leaves one to the conflict of elemental passions.</p>

<p>At last a thin line of red-robed monks was seen
to issue from the gate and descend the hill, each
carrying a bag of supplies. The crisis was over,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
and we were spared the necessity of inflicting a
cruel punishment. I waited to see the procession,
a group of sullen ecclesiastics, who had never
bowed or submitted to external influence in their
lives, carrying on their backs their unwilling contribution
to the support of the first foreign army
that had ever intruded on their seclusion. It
must have been the most humiliating day in the
history of Depung.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that it was not a moment
when the monks looked their best. Yet I could
not help comparing their appearance with that
of the simple honest-looking peasantry. Many of
them looked sottish and degraded; other faces
showed cruelty and cunning; their brows were
contracted as if by perpetual scheming; some
were almost simian in appearance, and looked
as if they could not harbour a thought that was
not animal or sensual. They waddled in their
walk, and their right arms, exposed from the
shoulder, looked soft and flabby, as if they had
never done an honest day's work in their life.</p>

<p>One man had the face of an inquisitor&mdash;round,
beady eyes, puffed cheeks, and thin, tightly-shut
mouth.</p>

<p>How they hated us! If one of us fell into their
hands secretly, I have no doubt they would rack
him limb from limb, or cut him into small pieces
with a knife.</p>

<p>The Depung incident shows how difficult it was
to make any headway with the Tibetans without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
recourse to arms. We were present in the city
to insist on compliance with our demands. But
an amicable settlement seemed hopeless, and we
could not stay in Lhasa indefinitely. What if
these monks were to say, 'You may stay here
if you like. We will not molest you, but we
refuse to accept your terms'? We could only
retire or train our guns on the Potala. Retreat
was, of course, impossible.</p>

<small>THE SETTLEMENT</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> political deadlock continued until within a
week of the signing of the treaty.</p>

<p>For a long time no responsible delegates were
forthcoming. The Shap√©s, who were weak men
and tools of the fugitive Dalai Lama, protested
that any treaty they might make with us would
result in their disgrace. If, on the other hand,
they made no treaty, and we were compelled to
occupy the Potala, or take some other step offensive
to the hierarchy, their ruin would be equally
certain. Ruin, in fact, faced them in any case.</p>

</div>

<p>The highest officials in Tibet visited Colonel
Younghusband, expressed their eagerness to see
differences amicably settled, and, when asked to
arrange the simplest matter, said they were afraid
to take on themselves the responsibility. And
this was not merely astute evasiveness. It was
really a fact that there was no one in Lhasa who
dared commit himself by an action or assurance
of any kind.</p>

<p>Yet there existed some kind of irresponsible
disorganized machine of administration which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
sometimes arrived at a decision about matters
of the moment. The National Assembly was
sufficiently of one mind to depose and imprison
the Ta Lama, the ecclesiastical member of Council.
His disgrace was due to his failure to persuade
us to return to Gyantse.</p>

<p>The National Assembly held long sessions daily,
and after more than a week of discussion they
began to realize that there was at least one aim
that was common to them all&mdash;that the English
should be induced to leave Lhasa. They then
appointed accredited delegates, whose decisions,
they said, would be entirely binding on the
Dalai Lama, should he come back. The Dalai
Lama had left his seal with Te Rinpoche, the
acting regent, but with no authority to use it.</p>

<p>The terms of the treaty were disclosed to the
Amban, who communicated them to the Tsong-du.
The Tsong-du submitted the draft of their
reply to the Amban before it was presented to
Colonel Younghusband. The first reply of the
Assembly to our demands ought to be preserved
as a historic epitome of national character. The
indemnity, they said, ought to be paid by us,
and not by them. We had invaded their territory,
and spoiled their monasteries and lands,
and should bear the cost. The question of
trade marts they were obstinately opposed to;
but, provided we carried out the other terms
of the treaty to their satisfaction, they would
consider the advisability of conceding us a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
market at Rinchengong, a mile and a half beyond
the present one at Yatung. They would not be
prepared, however, to make this concession unless
we undertook to pay for what we purchased on
the spot, to respect their women, and to refrain
from looting. Road-making they could not allow,
as the blasting and upheaval of soil offended
their gods and brought trouble on the neighbourhood.
The telegraph-wire was against their
customs, and objectionable on religious grounds.
With regard to foreign relations, they had never
had any dealings with an outside race, and they
intended to preserve this policy so long as they
were not compelled to seek protection from
another Power.</p>

<p>The tone of the reply indicates the attitude of
the Tibetans. Obstinacy could go no further.
The document, however, was not forwarded
officially to the Commissioner, but returned to
the Assembly by the Amban as too impertinent
for transmission. The Amban explained to
Colonel Younghusband that the Tibetans regarded
the negociations in the light of a huckster's
bargain. They did not realize that we
were in a position to enforce terms, and that
our demands were unconditional, but thought
that by opening negociations in an unconciliatory
manner, and asking for more than they
expected, they might be able to effect a compromise
and escape the full exaction of the
penalty.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>The first concession on the part of the Tibetans
was the release of the two Lachung men, natives
of Sikkim and British subjects, who had been
captured and beaten at Tashilunpo in July, 1903,
while the Commission was waiting at Khamba
Jong. Their liberation was one of the terms of
the treaty. Colonel Younghusband made the
release the occasion of an impressive durbar, in
which he addressed a solemn warning to the
Tibetans on the sanctity of the British subject.
The imprisonment of the two men from Sikkim,
he said, was the most serious offence of which the
Tibetans had been guilty. It was largely on that
account that the Indian Government had decided
to advance to Gyantse. The prisoners were
brought straight from the dungeon to the audience-hall.
They had been incarcerated in a dark
underground cell for more than a year, and they
knew nothing of the arrival of the English in
Lhasa until the morning when Colonel Younghusband
told them they were free by the command
of the King-Emperor. I shall never forget
the scene&mdash;the bewilderment and delight of the
prisoners, their drawn, blanched features, and the
sullen acquiescence of the Tibetans, who learnt
for the first time the meaning of the old Roman
boast, 'Civis Romanus sum.'</p>

<p>On August 20 Colonel Younghusband received
through the Amban the second reply to our
demands. The tone of the delegates was still
impossible, though slightly modified and more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
reasonable. Several durbars followed, but they
did not advance the negociations. Instead of
discussing matters vital to the settlement, the
Tibetan representatives would arrive with all the
formalities and ceremonial of durbar to beg us
not to cut grass in a particular field, or to request
the return of the empty grain-bags to the monasteries.
The Amban said that he had met with
nothing but shuffling from the 'barbarians'
during his term of office. They were 'dark and
cunning adepts at prevarication, children in the
conduct of affairs.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fp290"></a><a href="images/fp290.jpg">
<img src="images/fp290s.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />Colonel Younghusband and the Amban at the Races.</span>
</div>

<p>The counsellors, however, began to show signs
of wavering. They were evidently eager to come
to terms, though they still hoped to reduce our
demands, and tried to persuade the Commissioner
to agree to conditions proposed by themselves.</p>

<p>Throughout this rather trying time our social
relations with the Tibetans were of a thoroughly
friendly character. The Shap√©s and one or two
of the leading monks attended race-meetings and
gymkanas, put their money on the totalizator,
and seemed to enjoy their day out. When their
ponies ran in the visitors' race, the members of
Council temporarily forgot their stiffness, waddled
to the rails to see the finish, and were genuinely
excited. They were entertained at lunch and tea
by Colonel Younghusband, and were invited to a
Tibetan theatrical performance given in the courtyard
of the Lhalu house, which became the headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of the mission. On these occasions they
were genial and friendly, and appreciated our
hospitality.</p>

<p>The humbler folk apparently bore us no vindictiveness,
and showed no signs of resenting our
presence in the city. Merchants and storekeepers
profited by the exaggerated prices we paid for
everything we bought. Trade in Lhasa was never
brisker. The poor were never so liberally treated.
One day a merry crowd of them were collected
on the plain outside the city, and largess was
distributed to more than 11,000. Every babe
in arms within a day's march of Lhasa was
brought to the spot, and received its dole of a
tanka (5d.).</p>

<p>I think the Tibetans were genuinely impressed
with our humanity during this time, and when,
on the eve of our departure, the benign and venerable
Te Rinpoche held his hands over General
Macdonald in benediction, and solemnly blessed
him for his clemency and moderation in sparing
the monasteries and people, no one doubted his
thankfulness was sincere. The golden Buddha
he presented to the General was the highest pledge
of esteem a Buddhist priest could bestow.</p>

<p>When, on September 1, the Tibetans, after
nearly a month's palaver, had accepted only two
of the terms of the treaty,<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Colonel Younghusband
decided that the time had come for a guarded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
ultimatum. He told the delegates that, if the
terms were not accepted in full within a week,
he would consult General Macdonald as to what
measures it would be necessary to take to enforce
compliance. Their submission was complete, and
immediate.</p>

<p>Colonel Younghusband had achieved a diplomatic
triumph of the highest order. If the ultimatum
had been given three weeks, or even a fortnight,
earlier, I believe the Tibetans would have
resisted. When we reached Lhasa on August 3,
the Nepalese Resident said that 10,000 armed
monks had been ready to oppose us if we had
decided to quarter ourselves inside the city, and
they had only dispersed when the Shap√©s who
rode out to meet us at Toilung returned with
assurances that we were going to camp outside.
At one time it seemed impossible to make any
progress with negociations without further recourse
to arms. But patience and diplomacy
conquered. We had shown the Tibetans we
could reach Lhasa and yet respect their religion,
and left an impression that our strength was
tempered with humanity.</p>

<p>The treaty was signed in the Potala on August 7,
in the Dalai Lama's throne-room. The Tibetan
signatories were the acting regent, who affixed
the seal of the Dalai Lama; the four Shap√©s;
the Abbots of the three great monasteries, Depung,
Sera, and Gaden; and a representative of the
National Assembly. The Amban was not empowered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
to sign, as he awaited 'formal sanction'
from Peking. Lest the treaty should be afterwards
disavowed through a revolution in Government,
the signatories included representatives of
every organ of administration in Lhasa.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 7th our troops lined the
causeway on the west front of the Potala. Towards
the summit the rough and broken road became an
ascent of slippery steps, where one had to walk
crabwise to prevent falling, and plant one's feet
on the crevices of the age-worn flagstones, where
grass and dock-leaves gave one a securer foothold.
Then through the gateway and along a maze of
slippery passages, dark as Tartarus, but illumined
dimly by flickering butter lamps held by aged
monks, impassive and inscrutable. In the audience-chamber
Colonel Younghusband, General
Macdonald, and the Chinese Amban sat beneath
the throne of the Dalai Lama. On either side of
them were the British Political Officer and Tibetan
signatories. In another corner were the Tongsa
Penlop of Bhutan and his lusty big-boned men,
and the dapper little Nepalese Resident, wreathed
in smiles. British officers sat round forming a
circle. Behind them stood groups of Tommies,
Sikhs, Gurkhas, and Pathans. In the centre the
treaty, a voluminous scroll, was laid on a table,
the cloth of which was a Union Jack.</p>

<p>When the terms had been read in Tibetan, the
signatories stepped forward and attached their
seals to the three parallel columns written in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
English, Tibetan, and Chinese. They showed no
trace of sullenness and displeasure. The regent
smiled as he added his name.</p>

<p>After the signing Colonel Younghusband
addressed the Tibetans:</p>

<p>'The convention has been signed. We are now
at peace, and the misunderstandings of the past
are over. The bases have been laid for mutual
good relations in the future.</p>

<p>'In the convention the British Government
have been careful to avoid interfering in the
smallest degree with your religion. They have
annexed no part of your territory, have made no
attempt to interfere in your internal affairs, and
have fully recognised the continued suzerainty
of the Chinese Government. They have merely
sought to insure&mdash;</p>

<p>'1. That you shall abide by the treaty made
by the Amban in 1890.</p>

<p>'2. That trade relations between India and
Tibet, which are no less advantageous to you
than to us, should be established as they have
been with every other part of the Chinese Empire,
and with every other country in the world except
Tibet.</p>

<p>'3. That British representatives should be
treated with respect in future.</p>

<p>'4. That you should not depart from your
traditional policy in regard to political relations
with other countries.</p>

<p>'The treaty which has now been made I promise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
you on behalf of the British Government we
will rigidly observe, but I also warn you that we
will as rigidly enforce it. Any infringement of it
will be severely punished in the end, and any
obstruction of trade, any disrespect or injury to
British subjects, will be noticed and reparation
exacted.</p>

<p>'We treat you well when you come to India.
We do not take a single rupee in Customs duties
from your merchants. We allow any of you to
travel and reside wherever you will in India.
We preserve the ancient buildings of the Buddhist
faith, and we expect that when we come to Tibet
we shall be treated with no less consideration and
respect than we show you in India.</p>

<p>'You have found us bad enemies when you
have not observed your treaty obligations and
shown disrespect to the British Raj. You will
find us equally good friends if you keep the treaty
and show us civility.</p>

<p>'I hope that the peace which has at this moment
been established between us will last for ever, and
that we may never again be forced to treat you
as enemies.</p>

<p>'As the first token of peace I will ask General
Macdonald to release all prisoners of war. I
expect that you on your part will set at liberty
all those who have been imprisoned on account
of dealings with us.'</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the speech, which was
interpreted to the Tibetans sentence by sentence,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and again in Chinese, the Shap√©s expressed their
intention to observe the treaty faithfully.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The next day in durbar a scene was enacted
which reminded one of a play before the curtain
falls, when the characters are called on the stage
and apprised of their changed fortunes, and
everything ends happily. Among the mutual
pledges and concessions and evidences of goodwill
that followed we secured the release of the political
captives who had been imprisoned on account of
assistance rendered British subjects. An old man
and his son were brought into the hall looking
utterly bowed and broken. The old man's chains
had been removed from his limbs that morning
for the first time in twenty years, and he came in
blinking at the unaccustomed light like a blind
man miraculously restored to sight. He had been
the steward of the Phalla estate near Dongste;
his offence was hospitality shown to Sarat Chandra
Das in 1884. An old monk of Sera was released
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
next. He was so weak that he had to be supported
into the room. His offence was that he had been
the teacher of Kawa Guchi, the Japanese traveller
who visited Lhasa in the disguise of a Chinese
pilgrim. We who looked on these sad relics of
humanity felt that their restitution to liberty
was in itself sufficient to justify our advance to
Lhasa.</p>

<p>On August 14 the Amban posted in the streets
of Lhasa a proclamation that the Dalai Lama was
deposed by the authority of the Chinese Emperor,
owing to the desertion of his trust at a national
crisis. Temporal power was vested in the hands
of the National Assembly and the regent, while
the spiritual power was transferred to Panchen
Rinpoche, the Grand Lama of Tashilunpo, who
is venerated by Buddhists as the incarnation of
Amitabha, and held as sacred as the Dalai Lama
himself. The Tashe Lama, as he is called in
Europe, has always been more accessible than
the Dalai Lama. It was to the Tashe Lama that
Warren Hastings despatched the missions of
Bogle and Turner, and the intimate friendship
that grew up between George Bogle and the
reigning incarnation is perhaps the only instance
of such a tie existing between an Englishman
and a Tibetan. The officials of the Tsang province,
where the Tashe Lama resides, are not so bigoted
as the Lhasa oligarchy. It was a minister of the
Tashe Lama who invited Sarat Chandra Das to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Shigatze, learnt the Roman characters from him,
and sat for hours listening to his talk about
languages and scientific developments. The exile
of this man, and the execution of the Abbot of
Dongste, who was drowned in the Tsangpo,
for hospitality shown to the Bengali explorer, are
the most recent marks of the difference in attitude
between the Lhasans and the people of Tsang.</p>

<p>The present incarnation has not shown himself
bitterly anti-foreign. During the operations in
Tibet he remained as neutral and inactive as
safety permitted, and it is not impossible that the
hope of Mr. Ular may be realized, and an Anglophile
Buddhist Pope established at Shigatze.
Herein lies a possible simplification of the Tibetan
problem, which has already lost some of its
complexity by the flight of the Dalai Lama to
Urga.</p>

<p>In estimating the practical results of the Tibet
Expedition, we should not attach too much
importance to the exact observance of the terms
of the treaty. Trade marts and roads, and telegraph-wires,
and open communications are important
issues, but they were never our main
objective. What was really necessary was to
make the Tibetans understand that they could
not afford to trifle with us. The existence of a
truculent race on our borders who imagined that
they were beyond the reach of our displeasure
was a source of great political danger. We went
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
to Tibet to revolutionize the whole policy of the
Lhasa oligarchy towards the Indian Government.</p>

<p>The practical results of the mission are these:
The removal of a ruler who threatened our security
and prestige on the North-East frontier by overtures
to a foreign Power; the demonstration to
the Tibetans that this Power is unable to support
them in their policy of defiance to Great Britain,
and that their capital is not inaccessible to British
troops.</p>

<p>We have been to Lhasa once, and if necessary
we can go there again. The knowledge of this is
the most effectual leverage we could have in
removing future obstruction. In dealing with
people like the Tibetans, the only sure basis of
respect is fear. They have flouted us for nearly
twenty years because they have not believed in
our power to punish their defiance. Out of this
contempt grew the Russian menace, to remove
which was the real object of the Tibet Expedition.
Have we removed it? Our verdict on the
success or failure of Lord Curzon's Tibetan policy
should, I think, depend on the answer to this
question.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the despatch of
British troops to Lhasa has shown the Tibetans
that Russia is a broken reed, her agents utterly
unreliable, and her friendship nothing but a
hollow pretence. The British expedition has
not only frustrated her designs in Tibet: it has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
made clear to the whole of Central Asia the
insincerity of her pose as the Protector of the
Buddhist Church.</p>

<p>But the Tibetans are not an impressionable
people. Their conduct after the campaign of
1888 shows us that they forget easily. To make
the results of the recent expedition permanent,
Lord Curzon's original policy should be carried
out in full, and a Resident with troops left in Lhasa.
It will be objected that this forward policy is too
fraught with possibilities of political trouble, and
too costly to be worth the end in view. But
half-measures are generally more expensive and
more dangerous in the long-run than a bold policy
consistently carried out.</p>

<p>We have left a trade agent at Gyantse with an
escort of fifty men, as well as four or five companies
at Chumbi and Phari Jong, at distances of
100 and 130 miles. But no vigilance at Gyantse
can keep the Indian Government informed of
Russian or Chinese intrigue in Lhasa. Lhasa is
Tibet, and there alone can we watch the ever-shifting
pantomime of Tibetan politics and the
man&oelig;uvres of foreign Powers. If we are not
to lose the ground we have gained, the foreign
relations of Tibet must stand under British
surveillance.</p>

<p>But putting aside the question of vigilance, our
prestige requires that there should be a British
Resident in Lhasa. That we have left an officer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
at Gyantse, and none at Lhasa, will be interpreted
by the Tibetans as a sign of weakness.</p>

<p>Then, again, diplomatic relations with Tibet can
only continue a farce while we are ignorant of the
political situation in Lhasa. Influences in the
capital grow and decay with remarkable rapidity.
The Lamas are adepts in intrigue. When we left
Lhasa, the best-informed of our political officers
could not hazard a guess as to what party would
be in power in a month's time, whether the
Dalai Lama would come back, or in what manner
his deposition would affect our future relations
with the country. We only knew that our
departure from Lhasa was likely to be the signal
for a conflict of political factions that would
involve a state of confusion. The Dalai Lama
still commanded the loyalty of a large body of
monks. Sera Monastery was known to support
him, while Gaden, though it contained a party
who favoured the deposed Shata Shap√©, numbered
many adherents to his cause. The only political
figure who had no following or influence of any
kind was the unfortunate Amban.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Whatever
party gains the upper hand, the position of the
Chinese Amban is not enviable.</p>

<p>At the moment of writing China has not signed
the treaty; she may do so yet, but her signature
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
is not of vital importance. The Tibetans will
decide for themselves whether it is safe to provoke
our hostility. If they decide to defy us, then of
course trouble may arise from their refusing to
recognise the treaty of 1904 on the pretext that
it was not signed by the Amban.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that after the campaign
of 1888 the convention we drew up in Calcutta was
signed by China, and afterwards repudiated by
Tibet. For many years the Tibetans have ignored
China's suzerainty, and refused to be bound by
a convention drawn up by her in their behalf; but
now the plea of suzerainty is convenient, they may
use it as a pretext to escape their new obligations.</p>

<p>It is even possible that the Amban advised the
Tibetan delegates in Lhasa to agree to any terms
we asked, if they wanted to be rid of us, as any
treaty we might make with them would be invalid
without the acquiescence of China. Thus the
'vicious circle' revolves, and a more admirable
political device from the Chino-Tibetan point of
view cannot be conceived.</p>

<p>But the permanence of the new conditions in
Tibet does not depend on China. If the Tibetans
think they are still able to flout us, they will do
so, and one pretext will serve as well as another.
But if they have learnt that our displeasure is
dangerous they will take care not to provoke it
again.</p>

<p>The success or failure of the recent expedition
depends on the impression we have left on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Tibetans. If that impression is to be lasting, we
must see that our interests are well guarded in
Lhasa, or in a few months we may lose the ground
we gained, with what cost and danger to ourselves
only those who took part in the expedition can
understand.</p>

buildings. The most enlightened Tibetans are ignorant, or
pretend to be so, that Christian missionaries have resided in
the city. In the cathedral, however, we found a bell with
the inscription, '<span class="smcap">TE DEUM LAUDAMUS</span>,' which is probably a relic
of the Capuchins.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Suspicion and jealousy of foreigners seems to have been
the guiding principle both of Tibetans and Chinese even in
the earlier history of the country. The attitude is well
illustrated by a letter written in 1774 by the Regent at
Lhasa to the Teshu Lama with reference to Bogle's mission:
'He had heard of two Fringies being arrived in the Deb
Raja's dominions, with a great retinue of servants; that the
Fringies were fond of war, and after insinuating themselves
into a country raised disturbances and made themselves
masters of it; that as no Fringies had ever been admitted
into Tibet, he advised the Lama to find some method of
sending them back, either on account of the violence of the
small-pox or on any other pretence.'</p></div>

all your soldiers, and we will come to an agreement' (Tibetan
Blue-Book).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The situation was thus eloquently summarized by the
Government of India in a despatch to Mr. Brodrick,
November 5, 1903: 'It is not possible that the Tibet
Government should be allowed to ignore its treaty obligations,
thwart trade, encroach upon our territory, destroy our
boundary pillars, and refuse even to receive our communications.
Still less do we think that when an amicable conference
has been arranged for the settlement of these difficulties we
should acquiesce in our mission being boycotted by the very
persons who have been deputed to meet it, our officers
insulted, our subjects arrested and ill-used, and our authority
despised by a petty Power which only mistakes our forbearance
for weakness, and which thinks that by an attitude of
obstinate inertia it can once again compel us, as it has done
in the past, to desist from our intentions.'</p></div>

32nd Pioneers, and six picked men of the 8th Gurkhas. They
follow the main feeder of the Tsangpo nearly 500 miles, then
strike into the high lacustrine tableland of Western Tibet,
passing the great Mansarowar Lake to Gartok; thence over
the Indus watershed, and down the Sutlej Valley to Simla,
where they are expected about the end of January. The
party will be able to collect useful information about the
trade resources of the country; but the route has already
been mapped by Nain Singh, the Indian surveyor, and the

journal of Father Rubruquis, who travelled in Mongolia in
the thirteenth century. In 1253 he wrote of the Lamas:
</p><p>
'All their priests had their heads shaven quite over, and
they are clad in saffron-coloured garments. Being once
shaven, they lead an unmarried life from that time forward,
and they live a hundred or two of them in one cloister.... They
have with them also, whithersoever they go, a certain
string, with a hundred or two hundred nutshells thereupon,
much like our beads which we carry about with us; and they
do always mutter these words, "Om mani pectavi (om mani
padme hom)"&mdash;"God, Thou knowest," as one of them expounded
it to me; and so often do they expect a reward at
God's hands as they pronounce these words in remembrance
of God.... I made a visit to their idol temple, and found
certain priests sitting in the outward portico, and those which
I saw seemed, by their shaven beards, as if they had been our
countrymen; they wore certain ornaments upon their heads
like mitres made of paper.'</p></div>

of the Tibetan Government, as we have hitherto been acquainted
with it, there is an institution called the "Tsong-du-chembo,"

be compared with what we call a "National Assembly," or,

Dr. Morrison's summary contains the gist of them:
</p><p>
'1. Tibetans to re-erect boundary-stones at the Tibet
frontier.
</p><p>
'2. Tibetans to establish marts at Gyangtse, Yatung,
Gartok, and facilitate trade with India.
</p><p>
'3. Tibet to appoint a responsible official to confer with
the British officials regarding the alteration of any objectionable
features of the treaty of 1893.
</p><p>
'4. No further Customs duties to be levied upon merchandise
after the tariff shall have been agreed upon by
Great Britain and the Tibetans.
</p><p>
'5. No Customs stations to be established on the route
between the Indian frontier and the three marts mentioned
above, where officials shall be appointed to facilitate diplomatic
and commercial intercourse.
</p><p>
'6. Tibet to pay an indemnity of ¬£500,000 in three
annual instalments, the first to be paid on January 1, 1906.
</p><p>
'7. British troops to occupy the Chumbi Valley for three
years, or until such time as the trading posts are satisfactorily
established and the indemnity liquidated in full.
</p><p>
'8. All forts between the Indian frontier on routes
traversed by merchants from the interior of Tibet to be
demolished.
</p><p>
'9. Without the consent of Great Britain no Tibetan
territory shall be sold, leased, or mortgaged to any foreign
Power whatsoever; no foreign Power whatsoever shall be
permitted to concern itself with the administration of the
government of Tibet, or any other affairs therewith connected;
no foreign Power shall be permitted to send either
official or non-official persons to Tibet&mdash;no matter in what
pursuit they may be engaged&mdash;to assist in the conduct of
Tibetan affairs; no foreign Power shall be permitted to
construct roads or railways or erect telegraphs or open mines
anywhere in Tibet.
</p><p>
'In the event of Great Britain's consenting to another
Power constructing roads or railways, opening mines, or
erecting telegraphs, Great Britain will make a full examination
on her own account for carrying out the arrangements
proposed. No real property or land containing minerals
or precious metals in Tibet shall be mortgaged, exchanged,
leased, or sold to any foreign Power.
</p><p>
'10. Of the two versions of the treaty, the English text
to be regarded as operative.'
</p><p>
The ninth clause, which precludes Russian interference and
consequent absorption, is of course the most vital article of
the treaty.</p></div>
